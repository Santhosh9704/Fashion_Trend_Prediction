" And fashion trends that are gonna be huge in 2025 with affordable clothing recommendations. The first trend is Optuswear and Classic Taylor. 2025 is gonna be another big year for menswear as people are preferring to dress in a more smart casual way with the absence of large logos and branding. This means trousers with dark denim and oxards and knit pulls in the spring and summer paired with loafers. All clothing items are gonna be linked to my bio if you're interested. Next is sports inspired fashion. Drawing on Bloke Corps, which is a trend inspired by the style of football fans, Fendi and Louis Vuitton featured several jerseys on their runway, machino collaborated with PSG and with the likes of LeBron James, Dude Bellingham and Carlos Alcarez, all signing LV deals, sports and fashion are more intertwined than ever. eBay eti and Grail do the best places to find vintage football shirts, but don't sleep on brands like Pompeii who make lifestyle jerseys for casual wear. Statement prints were seen on runways in a big wave of floral and plaid making a comeback. This is obviously synonymous with spring and summer and can be a great way to incorporate detail and color into your wardrobe. And from a streetwear perspective, Camo is definitely an IRL trend that I see all the time. From real tree camo pants to hats, thermals and bomber jackets. This one might be the most polarizing, but shorts could also be getting shorter. When you factor in all the brands that displayed this look and the fact that GQ named Paul Mescal as the best dressed man alive, you may want to consider taking like day a little bit more serious. And for footwear, people are investing in boots and chunky boat shoes a lot more with brands like Dana and Paraboot rising in popularity. There's also a huge wave of new and exciting sneaker trends on the way, which I will be covering, so make sure you're following."," Summer 2025 trend predictions. Here we go. Let's see how I do. This is part one. There's a lot that I'm missing, but I felt like it would be too much to put in one video stuff. Okay, I feel like this is a good start. I did see this in a previous TikTok, but more dramatic. I mean, it's self-explanatory, but it's just chess kids. So simple, and it looks so elegant. So, I love this, and that's definitely gonna be a hit this summer. Another big one I feel like I'm already saying a lot of is sequence, and that'll be dresses, skirts, tops, purses as well. Okay, I feel like we all knew Cheetah was the it girl of last summer, and I still love it. It's definitely gonna be on trend this summer as well, but I will say I feel like Zebra Print is going to take over this summer. I feel like all animal print is just gonna be pretty big this year, but Cheetah Print, and then Zebra Print is going to skyrocket. Alright, moving on to some accessories. I've been seeing a lot of these chunky belts, and they always sit very low on the stomach. It's something that is added on top of skirts, dresses, sometimes even over at low-rise jeans. I think it's super, super cute, just to dress up and outfit a little bit more, but I'm trying to look for a good one if anyone can give me any recommendations. I like brab, so. Okay, so this gold bangle over here, I used last year, and I will say it elevated and outfits so much, and every single time I wore it, I got so many compliments on it. But I do see a lot of marble chunky bangles coming out this year, and I love it. I think that I might like it a little more than the gold, or even just combined. I really like this, the cuff as well, with the marble, and I'm also seeing a lot of mixed metals, like this picture over here, and just a lot of layering, stacking jewelry, especially bracelets. Stringy necklaces. This is a DIY this summer, and I'm gonna have to do a lot of, because, whoa, I love it. But this could be a little far fetched of me, but yeah, stringy necklaces, I feel like we'll be saying a lot of too. Yeah, maybe biased, because I have a purse like this, but I do feel like chunky bags, and studded like this, or the weave over here, we're gonna be seeing a lot of this wall. And this one over here, they have one Amazon, and I think I'm gonna have to link it on my lintry, because it's so cute. And last and certainly not least, in this video, scrunchies, big fluffy scrunchies, like the Spanish scrunchies are so cute. These hair clips, I am also saying around a lot more, and these, I mean, need I say more. But anyways, let me know if you want a part two."," 10 fashion trends that are going to be huge this spring, part one. Number one is buttermilk yellow. We've really been seeing this everywhere recently and it's not going anywhere for spring summer and this yellow is great to have in the wardrobe because it really blends well with all of your neutrals. I love it with this brown and this with the gray look is just perfection. Number two are silk scarves. I love how these add a pop of color and interest to this outfit but we've not just seen them around the neck like here, also seeing them styled around the waist and of course in the hair. Number three is the revival of the peep toe shoe but I think we're going to see them blended with a more modern twist now, which is peep toe mesh ballet flats and of course Swade trending last year and still on trend this year it's double denim. For me I feel like double denim is such an easy, effortlessly cool look. A really great way to utilize your capsule wardrobe basics. Personally I like double denim in a darker shade like this and finally we're seeing more over the top and less plain accessories, sequins, embellishments, bag charms, essentially seeing a little bit more personality."," winter 2024 trends that are worth investing in. So I spent a few weeks looking at Pinterest and scrolling through thousands of runway looks so you don't have to. And there are a ton of trends out there, but I think these are the trends that are worth your money because they'll continue to be around season after season. So number one, we have long coats. A long coat will instantly elevate your outfit. Although it might look like it's a trend because it's everywhere, it's actually a classic. A long coat will keep you warmer because it covers everything. I love this long cream coat, it just creams luxury. Number two is burgundy. We've seen the color burgundy over Pinterest and across the 2024 runway collection. Like Gucci, YSL, such a rich color. It's so elegant and chic and can act as a neutral one. I love seeing it in tights, heels or accessories like embags. Next we have pointed toe heels. They're worth investing in because they always come back and they elongate your legs. These YSL ones are living in my head, rent-free. Moving on, we have sheer tights. Tight trends appear every winter, but this year I feel like they've been given more attention and it's almost like tights are your accessory piece in the winter. So I love this look with the burgundy tights and this one with the lacy tights. It just makes basic outfit more interesting. Next we have gloves. Wearing gloves in the winter isn't a new thing. It's a classic, makes your fingers longer and look very classy. I love the short leather gloves here and the dramatic feel of the full length glove. Then we have the color blue. One of the 2024 trends is different tones of blue. And I've seen it in dresses and it suits. The color is so serene and it's calmer than the bold red color which we saw a lot in the fall. So you can style and it blue sweater with jeans like here or you can add blue through accessories like a scarf or shoes. Blue is a really good transition from a winter to spring wardrobe. So what do we think about these trends? Do we want a part two?"," Hi, Predicts Fashion Trends for a living, and this is what I'm predicting for Fall 2024. Except I'm not gonna include all the choo-vie little micro trends that we're gonna see this fall. These are like the cool girl timeless trends of Fall 2024. All right, the first one is Pops of Color. Whether it's in the shoes, the card again, the bag, you get it very simple outfits with Pops of Color. Next one, I know this is controversial, but boot cut jeans. Honestly, I think boot cut jeans are coming back in a very tasteful way. We've been doing the Baggy jeans, a tiny top combo for so long, and I think this fall it's gonna be a little bit reversed. Boot cut jeans have been coming in and out of style for years, so I would say this is a timeless trend. Another timeless trend that comes in and out of style is denim on denim. I think the real icons like Britney Spears are always wearing denim on denim, but we're definitely gonna see more of it this fall. And lastly is Animal Print, but not leopard print. We definitely have already overdone leopard print, and I think the coolest girls this fall are going to be wearing vintage animal prints, even like giraffe print, which is really cool, or also just tying animal print into your outfits in subtle ways. And that's it, those are the untrendy trends of fall 2024. Bye, guys."," summer 2024 fashion trends from you already know a fashion major. Part two. First up is this Americana aesthetic or vintage Americana like this, this, or this. This whole aesthetic has a lot of different current trends kind of built into it. One of the big ones being gingum like this or this especially a lot of red gingum. Next up this is one of the biggest ones for the whole summer. Typhrent tops like this, this, this, this, or this. This one's a little bit different style but typhrent all around. Next up we're seeing a lot of tops like this, this, this, or this. A lot in this heavier cotton like material, a lot with the collars, some detail like ruffles or embroidery. I'm seeing a lot with this very 50s kind of vibe. I love it. This is a little bit alarming to me because I feel the return of peasant tops coming which are really cute but that just means another 2010s trend is already back. They keep coming. I do think it's safe to say puff sleeves are definitely back. And everything that I just said applies to dresses too like this or this. And as you can probably tell red is still very much in this season. We're seeing a lot of all the primary colors too. So red, blue, yellow, especially paired together like for part three."," Spring, 2024 fashion trends from a fashion stylist, Part 6. First up, we are talking layers, but I don't mean just a sweater over your shirt or a jacket over your sweater. I mean denim under your tailored skirt. I mean trousers under a cocktail dress. I mean embellish leather pants under a mini dress. You get the boy. Just when we thought low rise was Lurage, designers were giving us this. I can't. It was not a drill. Super, super, super high rise was shown in so many different runway shows. Even Laura Piana, one of the classiest higher end brands, I'd really love to know your guys thoughts on this trend."," 2023 fashion trends, I will not be jumping on, I need to show you. Last time I did this, I got absolutely annihilated by a load of middle aged Trump supporters in the comments, so let's hope I don't lose my life this time. We just won't use the words, can you James again? Just want to know that this is my personal opinion, so please don't get your niggas in a twist, but the first one absolutely will die on this hill. These Ugg tazmin, whatever they're called, slippers are not supposed to be worn out of the house with an outfit. Get your fucking shit together. To be fair, this is the only one that I'm that passionate about, but honestly, I just don't get it. Just wear a pair of boots or a normal pair of Uggs. I love Uggs and I have the short Ugg boots, but these are so ugly. And I've not seen anybody style them where I've thought, oh yeah, they've styled that really nicely. Absolutely not moving on. This one's gonna ruffle a few feathers. This one is actually personal preference. I need something a bit chunkier, where a lot of wide leg stuff, baggy stuff, and I just feel like they're very thin, they're very flat, there is virtually no soul on it. So not for me in that sense. Obviously I'm aware in terms of the word trend that these have been around for years, and have been very popular for years, and I can appreciate that. But I think they suit a very, very specific sense of style, and now that they've become a popular trend, everyone's trying to jump on it, and you have to be aware of your own style. So a lot of people wearing these that don't know how to style them, they are difficult to style, and they just don't look right. I also don't think they're gonna be like one of those top trends for a very long. I think people are gonna realise that they're not very versatile, and yeah, personally for me, I need something chunkier that's gonna balance out the rest of my outfit a bit more. So genuinely, I would really avoid these. Next is checked prints, plaid, tweed, houndstooth, all of those. I really have a little bit of a hatred for these prints, and I always have, but other than that, they're really personally not my style. I'm not into that granny chic again, a very, very specific sense of style. If you can pull the granny chic off and that's your look, then fine, but I'm never gonna like these prints even if they look good on you. They're also just really not versatile. It's not something that's gonna be in your wardrobe that you're gonna reach for all the time. Again, really hard to style, like I would just avoid at all costs because you'll spend a load of money on a check coat and you'll wear it once, and then it'll be unvented the following week. Next, another one that's a classic style, I think, but has kind of dwindled in popularity in previous years, and is now coming back is plaid and boot cut jeans. Oh, I've got a lot to say about this one. If you are a shorter and curvy girl with kind of chunky thighs, which is me, I would absolutely avoid at all costs because honestly, I just think they look awful on that shape of body. And I can say that because I'm talking about myself. I just think they make you look really short and stumpy, which is why I picked this picture of Jennifer Aniston because I love her. And normally she's styled quite well, but you can see what it's doing to her legs here. They're low-wasted as well, which doesn't help. They're cutting her off and making her look stumpy and sticking to her thighs. I say this often, but this style of trouser and a lot of other styles of clothing in general are tailored towards what I like to call the Kendall Jenners of the world, the super skinny girls where you could wear anything, a bin bag, and it would look amazing. The average Joe that averaged me a new girl, eh? It's not for you. Just stick with something that is less stately, I think. OK, final one we're going for is these like long, suede again, a bit bow-ho-y, a bit hippy, jackets with the fur trim. This one's not as bad. I couldn't really find a picture of the one that I wanted to show you, but you know the one that's got like the really spiky fur? Just in general, hurry my eye. Oh, there's a no for me. It's not an absolute hate, but again, I don't think it's a trend that's going to be on top for long. I don't know, I just think I've seen these come and go and never really stay around for long, and my advice would actually be to invest in more of like just a standard good quality all fur jacket. Obviously don't buy real fur new. Either go fo fur or get a vintage fur, but I just think they're more versatile. They've stuck around for centuries, and you'll get more wear out of them, they're warmer, it'll stain your wardrobe for years, it'll you'll pass it down, just think more long term, I think. And that concludes this episode for anybody that actually gave a shit about my opinion. Admittedly, there are actually a lot of trends that I'm absolutely loving this year for this time of year, so I will make a video on that if you want a little bit of inspo."," Of course I can. And so here are some staple pieces for like fall and early winter that will help you achieve like all these amazing layered looks. And thank you so much for the idea too because I've been struggling lately to figure out what kind of videos to make. So really helped. The neutral knit sweaters, I really like the ones with the zipper detail because I just feel like it looks a little bit more elevated and gives it something extra. On some basic tanks and tees, the layer underneath those type of sweaters to give it just a little pop underneath. Super soft and cozy hoodie is bold with the zipper and then on. Straight leg vintage Levi's jeans, one in a light wash, one in a darker medium wash, and I'll tell you where to get them in the comments. Wide leg trouser pants, if you wanna look more put together some days, but then your so-be is so comfy. The perfect pair of leg grace sweat pants for one you wanna be more casual. Also a perfect pair of black leggings that you don't have to keep pulling up the one that you walk and do stuff. Upper jackets, if you wanna legit whole weather one and you can invest in a North Face, but if not, you can always stay on a bunch of other four options. Oversize leather jackets or oversized leather blazers, both can be dressed up or down. I have at least one oversized trench coat in your closet. Upper best for days that are like sort of cold, sort of not. I just ordered this dressier winter coat, but I always look in the men's section because that's how I find the perfect oversized fit."," end of April basically May so which means it's basically summer so let's get into the summer 2023 style and trends. Pinterest edition things I've had my eye on I have also added a lot of these things to my Amazon storefront under summer funds. Also I'm convinced I have the sweetest people following me. Thank you so much. Diving right in, linen. Linen is everywhere in the hats which I'm so thankful for. I love this for like a swimsuit cover up. Linen is the material of the summer and I'm obsessed. It's breathable. It's flattering. It's more elevated than just your cotton. I love this so much. You will not find me in a crop top however I have found some that have like a peplin bottom so much more flattering on my body top and most body tops so just keep that in mind when you're shopping for this. Lots of color which I am here for. I think this is adorable. I love this color combo. Pink and orange we saw it in the spring and it's carrying over to the summer. More color it's a little bit more muted. This is adorable. I love the bold larger print but yet it's still subtle. This is I love this. Very feminine, very flirty, very flattering for basically everyone. I love these little linen dresses. I think they are perfect where a straw handbag with a sandal statement. Jury Pearls, Tarkoy's gold. Gold is coming back. Silver tried to make a come back there for a little while but gold is one up to them. I love this combo. This is a lot. I would never wear all this together but some of these pieces by themselves are together. I love monochrome moments. I'm here for it. I've always loved a monochrome white but like an off-white with a white outfit. I think it is adorable and I love the statement subtle but statement belts. More on the belts too. I love this. The chunky gold buckle. Like it just breaks it up perfectly. I think floral anything blue anything with a print like this you're good to go. I love this. I'm not going to do a crop top by any means. I will do like a long maxi dress or midi dress but this print is giving me laugh. Lid leg pants are still in. Just make sure they're high waist like she has here. You see how it just gives her that hourglass figure. Just accentuates our waist add that belt. You can do a button down like she has which I love. You could do a body suit like I have on today. You could do a white t-shirt. You could do so many things with this. We're already at a time. You can find more inso on my Pinterest under summer vibes. I spent time this morning on Amazon trying to find all the things to recreate these looks. Find that on my Amazon under summer funds. Let me know if you have any questions. Like and follow for a part two. They are a trend that you've had your eye on and you're curious about. Let me know all of those things in the comments. Hope you have a great day.", spring 2023 fashion trends according to a New York City fashion style. First up we are talked my all-time favorite trend of all spring 23 and that is metallics. I do not care what color of metallic whether it's gold in a skirt version or silver in a pant version. There's any trend to follow in spring 23 metallic is it. The next trend is for the girl who said that cutouts are no longer in fashion. This trend was seen in pretty much every runaway show including Balmon and Chloe even Carolina Herrera. Carolina Herrera! That says something.," Welcome to part two of winter fashion staples. You're gonna want to get your hands on this season kicking it off with some chunky Knit I know super original, but I'm sorry this is just a trend that's gonna be around forever So invest in some good quality ones get yourself a nice white one a nice beige one just colors that you know You're gonna wear over and over and over. I recently got like three beige cable knit ones And when I tell you I have worn the living grip out of them already and it's not even cold out And you can even get some longer ones to make them look like little sweater dresses It looks like she has a little black mini skirt under it so adorable Like this is a good example of one that you will wear over and over and over and that's what we want We're trying to build our capsule wardrobe guys like we love it And I tell you I would dying go to heaven for this jacket. I'm not joking I feel like big fluffy faux fur colored jackets like this are things also you'll keep in your wardrobe forever You'll give them to your daughter like this is what we're trying to build guys I personally love this one. I just rented one that's very similar from newly and I just know I'm gonna wear it all month I feel like colorful jacket items like this just kind of elevate a simple outfit like she has on all black here But that pop of pink and the cool fur on the jacket. She just looks so much more stylish Oh like are we kidding? I feel like items like this are just such easy ways to spice up simple outfits like you just look So cool so put together so fashionable get yourself a pair of super oversized baggy denim You could tell these are really big on her be she rolled it over, but I actually love that like this is kind of a look I'm gonna copy you Emma and I love the dark wash denim It's so funny. I used to heat dark wash. I feel like we all did but now I'm starting to gravitate towards my darker wash items Turtle necks for winter obviously. I actually really like what she did here like a little turtle neck under a dress I just think again. This is such a cool way to kind of make yourself stand out look a little different Oh, I would never think of that type outfit like I love outfits like that I think another great jacket are these long trench coat style plaid ones I just think they're super cool kind of different not your standard plain like beige or black trench coat They add a little bit of spice to your outfits, if you will. I also love the colored one like I'm close this I would die for this jacket I feel like this is the second time I've said that I got to stop right there so cute And obviously there's longer style jackets keep you warm, especially if it's snowing Let me know if you guys want to part three or if you need help styling anything else this winter"," that are trending right now that are actually basics. It's no surprise that with the rise of the Coastal grandmother aesthetic, stripes are really trending right now. But this is such a classic pattern. You're not gonna regret investing in it. So we just talked about how belts are trending. I know that's like saying shirts are trending. I think a lot of us kind of stepped away from belts after the whole Gucci belt crisis. Obviously belts will always be around. But I would suggest getting something that's not super trendy. Leather jackets are having such a moment right now. But I do argue that they're a staple. I already get one now. I would personally get a vintage one. I just think with one like this, you can't go wrong. Like the next part."," summer 2022 fashion trends from you already know a fashion major. First up we have parachute pants. I am seeing these coming in hot. I feel like they're very similar to cargo pants which makes a lot of sense. These are just over the top baggy and loose, almost like a parachute. While we are seeing a lot of the super baggy ones like this, I'm also seeing a lot of more toned down versions like this that I think are a lot more wearable. Next up of course we have cargo pants and of course we have tube tops and just lots of strapless tops, strapless dresses, all of that. We're still seeing a lot of vest tops worn both on their own like this or like this and especially worn as an open vest like this or this. Another top that we're seeing a lot of is the split front top. Exactly what it sounds like you got a front and it splits. I'm seeing a lot with this specific silhouette like this with the little cutouts but we're honestly seeing them with just about any style top and if you don't want an entire split front there's still a lot with a very similar silhouette. Like for part two."," bring trends or the I'm obsessed with these green utility jackets right now. It's just a really modern fresh tape. I'm also really loving open back sandals. These Tory Burnt Millers are chef's kiss. This pendant necklace is probably shocking to some of you. It's really unique and I know it's not going to be everyone's taste. Also loving a skinny jean right now. So universally flattering. Finally, the Gucci belt. It's just such an investment piece that will always be in stock. Like for the next part."," Sock fashion trends coming in hot for winter 2021 starting with number one capes So it's not that capes are anything new people have been wearing them for many seasons now It's just that they've become more at the forefront of fashion this season fall winter 2021 We're seeing more high fashion designers showing them on the runway So it's something we're gonna see a lot more winter 2021 number two is going to go to patchwork denim I'm really here for this trend. I think it's really cool to vary like 70s vibes, but also very 90s like the cuts of the denim are very 90s, but then the patchwork is kind of like I don't know just like a throwback and I personally love this trend This is gonna be a three-part series, but number three for this video is gonna go to maxi coats Which Max Mara has been doing forever again? Not something incredibly new, but 2021 we're gonna see more exaggerated cuts at the forefront of outerwear"," Let's discuss the trends for fall 2021. Are you ready? Let's do it. This is two trends in one matching knit sets and the color rust This designer is Victor Gleman Checking out he had the most beautiful beautiful fashion week runway show. I love this outfit. Do you?

Every major designer has a crop jacket from Fenty to Sailor-Worn Everyone has been doing a crop jacket and this one is by La Jean. This is gonna be a big trend over pair jeans. I waste the jeans pair of shorts in leather for leather or over dress Kind of cool in and no Next trend, high waisted and when I say high waisted, I mean high waisted pair of jeans These are by Veronica Beard with the detail that is very Sailor inspired.

Yeah And those are the trends of the season at gallery cut off more is coming next video. I'll give you more trends gallery cut off dot com"," friends here are some of my favorite summer 2021 trends part two. This summer we're all about asymmetric everything. From one shoulder tops to quirky waistlines, asymmetry adds a bold touch to basics. Similarly, cutouts are huge this summer. I've seen this particular style of dress pop up all over my feet. I love how simple your eye catching it is. Finally, flare pants are all the rage. Not only are they super fun, but they're also ultra flattering, you are getting legs."," wasn't going to talk about this for a while but you asked so here's what I'm buying for spring might be a little divisive but I'm buying ballet flats. I would be wearing mine with baggy trousers and denim cutoffs also love them with a poofy dress. I don't like open-toed shoes so I think these are a good alternative. Now you don't have to stick with the classic pair. I love square toe coat options or you can get out for a pointed toe, ankle strap etc. Personally I'm ready for the ballet flat comeback."," fuller trends you need to trend this winter. Puffer coats and puffer vests are so in and they'll keep you warm. Love this vest version. Everyone needs a great pair of rectangular sunnies. You can find them on Amazon for under $10. Chunky Nets will help you be the cold and keep you cute. Brown leather pants are also gonna be a huge trend. And thank you, Ballo, for this. Also obsessed with this darker hue. I'm going to do an assumptions video this week so let me know your assumptions about me in the comments.",," Starting with a pair of high-waisted denim, adding on a crop top and a loose button down, throwing on the Jordans, adding a pair of sunglasses, and a bag to finish off the look and you're good to go.",
" Here are some of the men's trends that we will be seeing for March 2025. We've seen so many jeans, trends come back, but fled jeans and a boot cut more specifically will be coming back. It's a more of a slim fit but it's not skinny on the thighs and still has that boot cut. I think these are really cool because they still have that baggy edge as well. These ones from Zara are really great fit and a really accurate representation of the sort of style. The next trend is long sleeve polos. I mean we've seen the return of the rugby shirt but we're also going to be seeing these styles. They're more deconstructed and elevated and we'll be seeing in a lot more different materials like in cashmere blends. They also actually have a really great layering piece and we'll also see this buttoning minimalistic long sleeve come to. Then finally we'll see these very hats come back in. They've already been in for women's trends I would say, but now we'll see men especially in March when it's still colder in the springtime. They're also a really great accessory that elevates and makes the outfit look cooler."," These are the summer essentials that you want to consider for this year. Primary colors we're going to have pastel, pink, yellow and blue. I currently have my eyes on this gorgeous dress from Sister Jane. If you're on a hunt for a cute laser in powder pink, you can consider this one from H&M. It's fabric, tool is going to be a thing in Maxi's skirt like this, in dresses like this. It makes sense considering that we're going to have a voluminous silhouette. Super cute you can check this top of the never fully dressed or it is fun skirt from three people. I think that I'm so happy about the 90s plate are not going anywhere and we're still going to see it in skirts. By the way this is from Lisa Saga, but also in dresses. They're Maxi like this, also mini like this. A good investment will be teaser from Burberry. A tank top is going to be the statement to your outfit. This piece is not only the basic staple to your cups of wardrobe, also that piece that can never let you down because you can sell it in so many different ways or literally any occasion. Good quality, there is this one from Arquette. We're also going to have floral prints like this or this great investment. In my opinion it's definitely Zimmerman. They have the most gorgeous dresses and pieces in floral print that are just chef gifts. Yeah, a bag that represents your personality and it doesn't matter the size, shape or the texture as long as it reflects who you are if I was a bag. I will probably be here. Thank you for listening and let me know if you want part two."," All the spring trend predictions are out, so let's do some spring 2025 fashion trends that you can get off of Amazon So you can wear all the spring trends in your wardrobe, let's get into it You know, headscarves and leopard print are some of the biggest trends that we're seeing, so I love this combination Such a seal Spring shoes are taking on a little different look this season, and we're doing a lot of mesh and combining it with the polka dot trend So this is a fantastic shoe We know that butter, yellow, and softer yellows are the color of this season, and I absolutely love this As we're also seeing a lot of lace and shear We're seeing a huge influence of Y2K and boho chic, so this is a great combination, especially if you have any festivals or parties But using these individually and pairing them with other items is very practical and wearable So this is a great combination that you can get a lot out of On that same note, we're taking that and we're adding it to the Y2K, we're adding ruffles A little bit more florals, and we've seen in the past few springs We're seeing crochetes and woven and straw really being integrated into our everyday outfits Not only in bags, but in shoes as well We'll start to see this really come into fashion as we get closer to warmer weather And of course, we're adding mesh and leopard print to everything, and kitten heels are one of the biggest trending shoes that we'll be seeing So I love this combination, I think this is beautiful, it has character, but it's also understated Now here we out ballet course, one of the biggest trends that we'll start to see even more so this spring and summer I love this skirt because you can use it for so many different kinds of outfits Because it's a wrap skirt, you can really, from cowboy boots to kitten heels Ballet cord of boho chic, you can utilize this in so many ways And on the same note of the woven textures, we'll see lots of purses like this I think this is a great way to incorporate it while not being too loud Being very cohesive with the rest of your wardrobe And this will be in its staple skirt as we're doing a lot of maxi and midi skirts This will be a skirt that you always go back to"," 2024 fashion trends from a fashion major. First up, let's talk jeans. Still seeing a lot of the very baggy wide leg jeans like this. These are my favorite things to wear right now. Also seeing a lot of boot cut or flared jeans like this or this. I will also be participating in this one. Of course, we're still seeing a lot of cardigans like this or like this. Especially worn buttons with like a plain white T-end underneath like so. Next up we're seeing a lot of belts. A lot. Especially in a monochromatic style like this. Or this. Actually, I just got this one myself. Thinking of worrying about Thanksgiving. Last but not least some out of where. We're seeing a lot of long coats. And of course, still seeing a lot of fur or faux fur coats. Same thing with fur trim. I think I got bonus points for finding this one. Look at this coat. I love it."," for my top 10 trends for 2024. Red has been a huge trend throughout the fall and into the holidays. I think that it's something that's gonna continue to be really popular. I love a bright red sweater, especially paired with a t-shirt underneath. I think it gives it like a casual feel. I've been wearing this one a ton. This is actually from my Heritage Jewelry Collection photo shoot. I love the red tights, although I'm not sure if I can personally pull off this trend. I love this red coat, especially with the white tea and the jeans. And another way that you can add in red is through accessories, whether it's shoes like this or bags, suits or office core. And these are still really big. Blazers are such a big part of my everyday wardrobe and they're so versatile. I still love this slightly more oversized proportion. And I love that with a really great suit like this, you can wear them as separate. So you can wear the blazer with jeans or a skirt. And then the trousers you can wear with sneakers, a sweater, a t-shirt. You can play with proportion. You definitely don't need to go to oversized suits. These are just such a versatile piece in your wardrobe. As a millennial, the low-rise trend is quite honestly a little bit triggering for me. But thankfully we're not talking about the super, super low-rise jeans like the Dorena's with the one-inch zipper, if you know you know. We're just talking about low-or-rise. You can see Jennifer Lawrence did something similar here and the belt also looks really good with this trend. While we're on the subject of pants, the next trend is baggy pant, but we're doing a slightly more streamlined silhouette. So it's a little bit straighter as opposed to the very oversized look from last year. This can be done with jeans or with trousers, but I find they look really, really good with some kind of heeled boot or heel. They make your legs look so long. The more conservative, preppy aesthetic. It was actually an inspo photo from my Heritage Dore collection photo shoot. Filly feel like the 90s kind of Ralph Lauren preppy look is gonna be in for spring. I'm obsessed with these old Ralph Lauren ads. I love all of the layers and knit polos are definitely back. This one that I used in the shoot is from Banana Republic. I also love playing with the scarf, whether it's tied around your neck or kind of like tucked in a little bit more like an ass-gott. The preppy kind of news boy cap will be really big. This one is an old one of mine from Isabelle Morant. My husband calls me Kira Knightley and his from Love, actually, but I really love it, especially with hoop earrings."," Let's talk summer, 2020, 24 fashion trends that you might wanna know about. Let's get into it. The summer's all about reusing our trends that started and fall on this year. We're doing some was there, continuing their huge some was the gazelles, the idea shoes that we've seen they're so versatile, you can wear them in so many different ways. We're releasing them being integrated as a pop of color and we've been tied into an outfit like this. And of course the red that we saw during fall. It's truly the perfect summer shoe because it's so practical and go with anything, skirt, stresses, tops. That being said, the long skirt. The summer is about the max. The skirt was not coming during fall and it's continuing. This can be one of the sawmbas, truly any kind of shoe but we're also seeing prints being integrated into it. And of course the leopard print max is worth it. We all know and love it. Saking the fashion world by storm this season. We're seeing interesting waist being added to longer max skirts like this with Sophia Richie. And if that being said, let's talk about the balloon skirt or the bubble skirt. It'd be a little more casual like this with the sawmba trend that we're seeing. I think I was gonna like this but I would love this. Saking so many different variations even with dresses, one piece, two pieces, whatever you want. You dress it up, dress it down. But I think that this is so unique and not something a lot of people would normally gravitate towards what's such a fun option to branch out. Knows the rise of denim and denim best are huge. Denim and general but this vest look is so freaking cute. I love it. It can be a top or bottom but just in general, the denim top is just gorgeous. We're seeing it part of a lot of long white max skirts like this. Truly is just such a fun little combination. I love it. That being said, the long white max skirt is taking over. You can wear it, you can dress it up, dress it down with a t-shirt with the denim vest like we saw, it's so cute. We're seeing a lot of belts being added to it and just casual tops, cute tops, whatever you want. We feel like we've all seen this. This is like the outfit, the set of the summer. It's giving Italy, it's giving time as I think it'll use this every year, especially if you go on vacation to Europe and all. Orges. I personally have a few myself. They do in part two, there's a lot more."," What kugles will be wearing for spring 2024? Part five. They're going to be seeing a ton of blue. We'll see lots of blue monochromatic outfits. And we'll be seeing lots of blue accessories. I love this Prada bag. Blue is essentially this year's red. Denum and denim is kind of losing its popularity, but we're still gonna be seeing lots of denim tops, specifically vests and sleeveless tops like this. My favorite way to see it styled is a denim top with statement pants. Vests are going to be extremely popular in spring, but specifically we're gonna see it paired with a matching short like this. So chic but also a little bit more warm weather friendly than like a full on like pantsuit. Parat with a pair of cowboy boots, and I seriously think you're a golden. Charm necklaces, I absolutely love them. They pair perfectly with all these really dinty necklaces that we've been really into the last couple of years. They're a great addition to any outfit and I love how personalized they can be. So cute and honestly a perfect girls night craft idea."," Here are my winter fashion mood boards for 2023 as it is Australia here and we are coming into winter. Feel free to save these and use them if you wish. This is purely based on my style, what I like, pieces that I currently have and maybe a couple of pieces I need to invest into. Add to my wardrobe. I've also looked at some trends that are coming up for winter and this is based on trend reports, local data and just what we're seeing on the runway. So first up is chocolate. I'm obsessed with a really beautiful rich chocolate suit. That's me in the top left so I've already got one and I feel like I'm going to be wearing it to death. So pairing it with other black or white that's me doing the top with black and then also just different hues of the chocolate also down the bottom there with the skirt. Teddy code, I got my last year but I'm going to be wearing it to death again this year. This was a friend with Frank one. A trend she's classy for beige trench and that's with the revival of the burberry trench but Google searches have gone up by trench coat by 30% which is wild. But yeah I like this sort of sporty trench vibe so with the hood over the top of it paired with like a baseball cap. Pared with jeans, cons, really cash vibe but I really do like that sort of jumper over the top like that bottom left. I wear an oversized blazer all year round but they're just they're not going anywhere they really are a timeless piece but just in a variety of colors as well. I wear them as a coat out just over a really nice dress if I'm going out for dinner so that acts as my coat if it's not too cold during the winter. I like the juxtaposition of like a really beautiful feminine dress and a nice boxy oversized blazer. A trend piece that I'm going to buy into I really like the rose troker we're starting to see it it's like a rose you can make it with a scarf or you can actually buy it like a troker like that. I even just really like the idea of a next scarf and I'm going to start wearing one. A beautiful double breasted wool fabricated really detailed boxy silhouette. Floor length trench is what I'm after. I'm going to buy one of these for this season. There's other friends with Frank or a Hany one that I've got my eye on. Lots of lace this season again I like the like the opposing masculine and feminine with the lace and the boxy jackets. I love all these references here. Leather but there's also the vegan leather again Hany has a vegan leather option there. Doesn't just have to be like a bomber jacket but any style of leather jacket. The Colour Navy we're seeing a lot with Maggie Marilyn. I really want another oversized blazer in navy but I feel like I do have a lot of oversized blazers. Deon Lee the reference down the bottom there that's dual leaf are. They also say kilterscirts are coming back in. I didn't mention that one though because I don't think I'm buying into that but yeah I do like even just wearing the navy and black together. Jumper collar vibe and this is sort of sprung from the whole quiet luxury. In Bezile Dernan we're seeing a lot of it over in Europe already so we're definitely going to see it triple down into Australia. Hawaii boots were a summer spring trend which are moving into winter as well. Cool edgy like that a name being referenced on the bottom run out of time let me know."," I have a theory that everyone looks better in fall outfits, so here are some of the trends I'm looking forward to seeing. Used to hate these shoes with the passion, and now I think I finally understand them. They look so sheet. Mixed feelings about the ones with metal like this. I honestly kind of prefer the more manly looking ones like this, but they're so cute, I think I'm gonna have to get them. Some more cute loafers. Everyone keeps saying red is gonna be the color of the season. I love it as a pop of color like this. More a little bit more sexy like this top. I still haven't found a bunch of pieces that I totally love yet, but I'll keep you updated. Or something like these cute little ballet flats. Also the cuff jean I've been seeing a lot, which is perfect because all my jeans naturally do this because I'm five two. Also really love this chocolate brown for the fall, and that kind of boat neck super elegant neckline. It's so flattering and feminine I love it. Of course, knee high boots with a short sweater, so so cute."," Today's edition is not really a trend, more so just like staples that I am loving and kind of like The vibe that I want to bring to my outfits. Like let's stop here I love the oversized baggie tea the little skirt. I think like the basic mini skirts like this are gonna be so in And I love a graphic tea like I just am feeling the classy vibes this year like this outfit Just screams put together big basics elevated She's like added some detail with the belt like this is just such a vibe like this little mini dress moment The sunnies the pop of color with the bag I'm also obsessed with this like two turns look. I just think it's so cute very 90s I genuinely have like a million of these little outfit flat lace saved on my Pinterest because they are so cute Everything about this is just giving French of course. I found pieces for you I think this little two-tone tank from crop shop beauty would be it's so cute especially with those mini skirts They have like a bunch of little crops versions as well If you want to like bring it into your workout moments a staple skirt is key And I think this one is perfect from with Harpalu and of course it comes in white as well Now literally all of my staples are either from Suprae or glass ends like this little baby tea from suprae comes in so many colors I just got this single from suprae and it is the perfect fit. I cannot emphasize that enough It is exactly what I was looking for and it's literally only $20 They also have like heaps in their like luxe collection when I was in saw the other day this maxi skirt caught my eye And I think it'll be perfect for like a summer maxi afternoon drinks And of course, I'm sure you've seen this brand all of your view page But I think in print we trust we'll just have the perfect amount of baby teas like they have so many options I also pulled some faves from bambi i wear They're quite similar, but I think just like the sleek vibe is so perfect for some of this year So let me know what you think I normally go really bright and fun for summer And I probably still will but I really just love The neutral classy vibe at the moment"," These are the top three most searched fashion trends in Australia, according to Google. And if you don't know the last one, you might be living under a rock. Has been around for a while, cargo pants, but really it's not going anywhere. It's the perfect spring style. It's a great transition release to neutral tones available. So we've got the car key green, you've got more of beige tone. And of course for my Melbourne girls, black is always in fashion. You can accessorize this in a really nice way to take it to a more dressy look, as well as super casual with like your sneakers or your burks. And just like a tank top. And that was sort of like 90s and five. The other massive trend we are seeing are light jackets. So this can also be called like a bomber jacket, but it's really not puffy. It's just sort of like a light padded style. And again, you know, with those neutral tones, they're really popular. So we've got the car key green, gorgeous grey. And of course, black. She styled it very simply. She's got a black top, a slouchy blue jean and a biker boot. Now this is one to watch in this show. I really love this styling here. It was sophisticated. You've got the plaid pant and a white button down and sort of oversized underneath the collar. It just creates this really chic vibe. Now if you've already guessed what number three is, congratulations. You are a fashionista, but if not, let me do reveal. It's the added as samples. Now these things are impossible to get. They are literally sold out the minute they come online. So good luck to you if you're trying to pick up a pair. Blacks are good option if you don't want to be too on trend or you're not wanting to buy into the super trendiness of it. They are a really versatile shoe. You can see actually all three trends together. So you've got your flat jacket, your cargo pants, and your sunbursts on. They look really chic in sort of this summer dress style, which is just like a basic t-shirty sort of tank dress. You can go back with your long denim skirts and your plain white tanks. And there you have it. Those are the three most Google styles in Australia for this spring."," I haven't seen many videos talking about winter 2022 fashion trends since fashion's probably gonna be one of the only things Like gets me through this winter I figure I can toggle what some of the trends that I've been seeing This glamour that all my research has come from Pinterest my own personal Pinterest the first trend I feel like I've been seeing a lot of I'm gonna call the more fabric the better Which is basically just oversized baggy everything which of course in the winter is amazing the more layers the better my things are Oversize that means that you can layer more underneath I feel like traditionally we always go for like the tighter fitting top and loose pant I'm trying to get some contrast in there, but I feel like recently we've been embracing just wearing as much clothes as we can Instead of doing an oversized blazer with a tight mini skirt I've been seeing oversized blazers with Maxi skirts instead of pairing an oversized bomber with fitted trousers We're seeing baggy trousers with oversized bombers I've been seeing mini skirts. We've been seeing maxi skirts like as long as possible This low-cheek trench coat has been a trend now for a couple of years if you're gonna be thrifting a new one I feel like you can definitely go for as Oversized and baggy as your heart desires with a maxi trench coat You can't really see the outfit underneath, but I still think there's something so cool about seeing a pair of oversized trousers At the bottom of that trench coat So I want to talk about how we can get accessories involved in this trend I know everyone's been obsessed with the skinny scarf recently But I feel like with this as much fabric as possible trend you can definitely go for the big chunky knit scar A lot of people have just been wrapping their chunky knit scarves around their head to look like a balaclava Which again you've got all this fabric going on from literally head to toe I've also been seeing a lot of oversized bags AKA just not mini bags which is again amazing for winter because if you're wearing a big chunky jacket Those mini bags do not fit over your shoulder. They're just not practical Having a bigger bag where you can fit your hat and your scarf and your gloves into when you go inside is amazing And then for winter boots we've all seen how uggs have completely taken over again And I absolutely love the way that uggs look underneath a pair of baggy jeans or trousers So I'm definitely gonna be participating in this trend all winter because I love dressing practically But yeah, let me know what you think of this trend and stay tuned for the next video in the series", All trends and how to style the split hem pants are back.

Going with the vibrant colors we have lots of vibrant pink like this, this, this, this, or this. And pink in orange is a really hot color combo this summer. Like it's so cute. We're also seeing lots of lime green like this, this, or this. Another color that I'm seeing a lot of is this rich cream. I love it. Lots of pale yellow like this, or a little brighter like this, or buttercream yellow, so buttery and almost looks cream. Last up I'm seeing lots of gray notches for summer but year round. Lots of gray and navy. The past few years I've noticed an increase in more vibrant and or more color tone colors as opposed to more muted earth tone warmer tone colors. Overall, not absolute. Gonna have to make a part two with the patterns."," Jacket and Outerwear trends for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Part two. First up, I feel like this one doesn't even need to be explained, but a good blazer. We're especially seeing a lot of cropped blazers. I love this one might not really come to mind when you think of Outerwear, but a good button up shirt. Used as a jacket, of course. I honestly think this one's my favorite for spring and summer. It's super lightweight, super breathable, and I love in Texas, so we can have actual jackets. So I feel like this is just the perfect alternative. We're also seeing a lot of jackets like this. This exact one is from Girf Avenue, honestly, all of their pieces, especially Outerwear right now, or just... I'm seeing a lot of the zip up knit jackets like this. I think it's great for spring and summer, and they're just so cute. Like this. I also think it's a great way to add some color, especially pastels. It's giving very scandy, a Copenhagen vibes. I love it. I like for Part 3.", Sashin Trends for Winter 2021. Cape Cotes. Mini Dresses. Pattern Sets. Fox Fur. Net Maxi Dresses. Sheeds of Green. Dark Dunham.," It is totally about time that I do my fall fashion predictions. I'm gonna do fall slash winter because I feel like they can be kind of combined into one, but this might be two parts just warning you, but I'm gonna try to squeeze as much as I can into this one video. First up on the trend forecast, we have Kelly Green. Kelly Green is going to be the color of the season. It's going to be used in accessories like shoes that you can see here. We have it in these jeans here and then also this trend I'm gonna bring up later, but a bunch of funky knits. So I'm kind of talking about both right now, but... but Poverjackets will be coming back because they're useful, they're cute, but this one in Kelly Green, and I'm telling you it's gonna pop off again this year. So if you had it from last year, you're in luck. Like I mentioned briefly, a lot of funky knits like crazy colors, just like crazy patterns and stuff. And then also this is a runway looks with a little bit dramatic, but chunky knits are also going to be in so beyond just like the colorful crazy patterns. chunky, the chunky are the better. Pretty much in a sweater. I found this sweater from Selfie Leslie, and I think it's so stunning because it has the puff sleeves that have been in trend recently, but it's also just like a very chunky sweater in the sleeves, but then it's still pretty classic. Sherpas are going to be back again, but I think that they're going to be a little bit more wild and crazy than the ones from last season like the one I'm wearing. They're going to be like a little bit more bright patterned, fun, and then of course these ones will be back as well. Here's a really cute example of a Sherpa jacket from its Juliet. I actually ordered this one and it's in the mail, so I'm so excited to get it, but it's kind of like patchwork, but not like the cringey patchwork, and then Sherpa and denim. But because I just mentioned denim, denim will also be huge this fall and winter. I feel like we're going to see the Canadian tuxedo, but not just your typical Canadian tuxedo only. Stuff like this where it's a little bit more funky, jazzy, like this isn't like a full Canadian tuxedo has some like pattern going on. Okay, also if you live in a warm climate, this might be good for you. This kind of trend is going to be huge again as well. So it's kind of like the glove trend, but like making it useful because you can't really wear gloves everywhere you go. So the sleeves that are detached from the shirt and then similar to that, like the cardigan sleeves are also going to be very popular.

," Six fashion trends for summer 2025. Some of these I really hate. Let's start with one of the good ones, navy in general, but navy nautical. So chic. Not talking about this, a hoist skipper vibe. No. Even though I crossed off their faces. There are Amazon models, you guys signed up for this. More like this sophisticated nautical vibe. Listen, this is not something brand new. There's just more of a focus on this beautiful chic nautical and overall navy aesthetic. Number two, also a good one, the Bohemian revival. Oho means different things to different people, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here. Not this fluffy hat. Excuse me, ma'am's. Where's your Coachella Ferris? We, I don't make the rules. I mean, I do, but I'm talking loose, flowy, boho. Think old school Chloe. These are perfect examples of like, boho done really well. Number three pleated shorts, my god, I hate this shit. These are really nothing new. Carried over from last season, but they're still so in demand so popular. I don't know why. Pleated bermuda, could never be me. Number four, the slip as address, the slip dress. A lot of these trends have been going on. It's just a heightened focus on them more and more. Number five, denim on denim, but in a majorly elevated way, I'm all over this one. It's such an easy casual way to just look stylish, so good. Really something you have to think about. The denoms never have to match a vibe. In number six, hasdels, powder, pinks, powder, yellows. It really just doesn't matter because I'm, I'm just gonna wear black anyways. Are you running and buying a pastel pink blouse? No, you're not. So who cares? I'm just giving you the tea, that's what it is. And those are the trends for summer 2025. And that's it for today. Mommy loves you. Come on."," Fashion trends I see girls wearing that let me know she is an actual fashionista. Loafers can be kind of tricky to style so if there is a girl wearing the first not only with socks, but socks over top of stockings, immediately yes. This takes a confident girl who just knows what she's doing. Another example of this I love all the gray. One of my long time favorite looks, the double layer waistband pants. We're often seen in denim also like this. It definitely takes a certain girl to wear these pants and if she is wearing them I'm neatly wondering who she is. Next up is shoelace slash sneaker charms. Even better if more subtle like this. I don't love these giant pins as much and don't even get me started on the Miumio by a new balance collab. If there are charms on these sneakers I want to be friends with that girl."," made a living off of predicting fashion trends for a few years now so these are gonna be this winter's hottest trends and whether or not I will be partaking in them. The first one is obvious faux fur faux fur everything though for bags for coats for headpieces like it's giving apricy and I love it. Another trend that I absolutely love is fair eye omnits. These look like this they look like grandma knits kind of but I think they're so cute and again it gives that like vintage ski girl vibe. I also think sheerling and Sherpa is gonna be a huge trend not only on clothes but again on bags, headpieces, gloves, riding boots but I think they're gonna be worn with leggings, skinny jeans maybe and most popularly skirts. I won't be participating in the leggings and skinny jeans thing but I will wear them with skirts. Also I feel like moon boots are gonna come back but I don't know about that one. Wearing monochromatic white outfits is gonna be a huge thing just like white on white are wearing really light colors like light beige tan oatmeal this like Sherpa color you get the vibe and then old money quiet luxury is kind of a trend for almost a year now but I think that that will continue into the winter. People are gonna be dressing very preppy lots of v-neck sweaters, cable knits, very simple outfits that look really elevated and then of course there's gonna be a ton of little micro trends within all of that but I don't really talk about those on here. Hey that's it let me know what you guys think if my trend predictions are right or wrong um I think they're right. Love you guys bye"," all trends and how to style the flats are officially back. We all know this and I would style them like this, this and this. Lady jackets are definitely having a moment right now and I would style them like this, this and this. We're also going to see a lot of leopard pop up and I would style it like this, this and this, like for the next part."," It's official, fashion people will live in these nine specific jean trends in 2024. Anyone who wore extra long jeans in their teens will tell you that these are not the trousers you want to wear when there's a rain forecast. On dry days however, there's no denying that puddle jeans look cool. Not just for spring summer, soft cream-turned-jeans work year-round. I like wearing mine with a black leather jacket for contrast. Prevalent on the runways, you can expect to see this jean trend ramp up this year. Whether you take a longer pair and DIY them, we opt for pre-coft option. We're seeing more and more designers creating and influences wearing turn up jeans. Silver trousers have been one of the dominating trends this season. And now we can expect to see them transition into everyday attire by way of jean type fabrics and silhouettes. Flair jeans exude French appeal and tap into the 70s aesthetic, which has been at the heart of fashion for a few seasons now. If you're yet to embrace flares, consider 2024 the perfect year to do so. Pale vintage type washes have dominated the jean space for some time now, but we're seeing more of an appreciation for the deep blue pairs. Shades reminiscent of what your dad might pick. Keep your silhouettes loose and relaxed for modern take. Love them or hate them. Rip jeans are everywhere right now. And we're willing to bet that's going to be the case for much of 2024 too. For the sleekest possible take, look for clean rips to the knee as opposed to distressing all over. Mewchin around the spring summer press days, our fashion editor, Remi Farrell, was surprised at the sheer volume of grey jeans on display. You may wish to take that as a cue to invest in a pair pronto. Once you notice a trend, you start seeing it everywhere, and that's definitely the case where overly-seemed jeans are concerned. From twisted panels to add-in and seemed just for the sake of it, this is one jean's trend we didn't expect to see."," Spring 2024 fashion trends that I will be implementing. First up is this butter yellow. It can be a little bit darker too, but I really like the light pop. Ideally, the Indy Anderson dress, but I love it in cardigan form too. I will be implementing it like this. This is a top I wore in Spain two years ago, and this top I wore last summer. My second one is striped pants or like those boxer pants. I keep seeing this Studio 7 all over TikTok and I'm so tempted to buy them. I just got this red pair and I can't wait to wear it out, not just in bed. Next is the chic vest. I honestly like the long version and not the cropped. I think this is so cool as a set and you could wear it with jeans if you want to switch it up. I wore this one, but I'm excited to do more longer styles and like not matching sets. Like I honestly prefer this longer look. Similarly, I also like this bow tie up. I think that looks so cool instead of buttons. I haven't worn this yet, but I got this one from Revolve. And lastly, as I'm in Chicago and it's still Chilean spring, the oversized leather jacket. I honestly just need a good leather jacket. So bad if anyone has recommendations. This is the one piece I'm missing from my closet. I probably screenshot of this picture like seven times because I love everything about it and I've just got the green shoes."," coming and I think that winter trends really get overshadowed by the fall because people just get bored with the cold weather outfits and they just start adding a boring puffer on top but winter trends have a lot to offer. There's a lot you can do so let's go through a few and spell examples. The whole ski lodge kind of style has become a major trend over the past couple of winters. I think this is a really good example of it. She's obviously not about to go skiing but she's got her base layer on, a nice cozy sweater and the moon boots are obviously a really big winter trend. The rolls are probably not going skiing but you can tell they're in some kind of a wintery wonderland lodge and lots of fur, the fun little hats, the sunglasses. I mean I I really like this and here's another example a little bit more casual and another one for good measure. Fur is a classic winter staple. I do feel like it's becoming more trendy to wear the big fur faux coats but I do think these are generally timeless pieces. This is my favorite example. I think this coat is so so cute. And another one in a more brown kind of tone. Winter philosophy is just add tights. I honestly think tights can make an outfit. This is an example of that and if you get fleece line tights I'm not kidding. You will probably be sweating your ass off if you walk anywhere. They insulate you so well. I'm also a huge fan of winter white outfits so basically a full kind of off white outfit. I think it's so chic and classy for the winter time. For example, and of course we can't talk about winter time without the ug trend. The ugs are here. They're here to stay. The platforms, the non-platforms, they're all trending. And if your style leans a bit more street style here's an example of that winter white fit for you. Finally this is nothing to do with clothes but we can't underestimate the power of a cute hair style to make an outfit when your whole outfit is literally just outerwear. This would be a super boring picture if her hair wasn't in a braid in my opinion. This is just a messy bun but otherwise her hair would be covering her earrings and the sides of her glasses so the accessories would be totally lost in this outfit. Can't go wrong with a claw clip situation either. Same deal with the glasses and earrings. They would be covered otherwise. I also think this is a super cute option. And that is all. Let me know if you want more of these. This is all saved on my Pinterest under winter 2023."," Let's talk Fall 2020 fashion trends. Part one, we've seen the runway. We know what we can expect. It's a little early, but also it's never too early, because Fall is coming around the corner and it'll hit us faster than we know it. There are a lot of fun things this year. We can look forward to. Let's get into it. Color red. So red is the color of the season. We saw it all over the runway. Every fashion girly, every fashion person's talking about it right now. It is so beautiful and so fun. It's a little different than what we've experienced because normally red is like more of a Christmas color, but we get to experience it in like bright, cherry red specifically, but bright red, muted red, all different kinds of reds being integrated into boots. And I think it's specifically coats as well, but red is the color of the season. Cherry red specifically is so beautiful. So in bags and boots, whichever way you want to style it, coats, bags, boots, I feel like that's kind of how we'll see it most. French coats, all those similar things that we've seen just being integrated with the color red instead of just neutrals. But it's so fun because it adds a pop of color and it really elevates any basic outfit and makes it fashion girly outfit. You know what I mean? It's a thick, it's a very easy way to elevate any outfit that you have. So I'm really, really loving this trend. Another example of how you can wear it, this is like a very blurry picture, but you could do it in a blazer, a fellow blazer. I think there are a lot of fun options for this. If you're not down for the bright cherry red, you could do like a brown, a little tint of red into it and that's a good way to incorporate that into your style. Another color we have are more olive greens. So this kind of green, the base of olive green that we've kind of seen, I think that sage green will continue to trickle on, but just a lot of greens. Again, this is a little more muted, a little more neutral, but this right here, exactly, I feel it will be a huge trend along with the jacks, so we'll talk about the next part. But this olive green as well as this yellow, it's a lot of different forms of this yellow, but along the same line, they meal different fonts. And I think that it's gonna be really fun because we're bringing a lot of more bright colors that can also be muted down into fall, whereas normally we stick to that for like summer, in spring, typically speaking. But this allows you to really use everything in your wardrobe at once, or to just add like a big pop of color to make something a little more statement like I was talking about earlier. But this yellow is so fun. It's also a bit 70s, which is kind of the next trend. A lot of 70s inspired looks on the runway, and even though this is a little bit more 90s and 70s, I think it's a fun way, if you're not completely, you're how to make it wearable. This is a good way to do it. I also last year took these pictures. I don't love the pictures, but a good way to incorporate it very easily are kind of just like flare pans. These are corderoid, they're brown, they've got a yellow tint to them, that kind of orangey color. So you can really integrate that yellow 70s color into just a fine piece like your pans, or whatever it may be, again, I know these are orange. But they've got like the 70s flare. Oh my god, I hate this picture, but I feel like this is a very good wearable way to bring it in a little bit. The long sleeve kind of tight up. It's always like difficult taking what you see on the runway and bring it down to very wearable styles. I feel like this is a good way to do it. Hate these pictures that really old, but 70s inspired outfits. There's so much more, so I'm gonna take this and go to a part two.", talk summer 2023 fashion trends that I'm excited for. What wear says? Cobweb weaves but honestly it encompasses all types of knitwear and different crochet types which can be found in beachwear. Regular knit dresses with different types of geometrical working. As you can see all different types of crochet designs at work here. Up next we have the motor cross club which is that like Motomami type of vibe. A nice leather jacket is perfect for all year round but it definitely fits this trend. Honestly you're gonna find a lot of leather so I would stick to this in the nighttime so that you're not burning up in the summer heat. Next up we have heavy metal which is all types of metallics. This chrome look kind of gives off that futuristic type of vibe. Even in accessories it's super cute. You can even play around with different colors like this. I need to add to my closet. Next we have this blurry pattern vibe. These items are not quite tie-dye but they're also not a set type of pattern. And the key thing with adding trends to your look is to add it in the way that matches your style. The last trend I have is this transparent type of pattern but I think it also goes hand in hand with the ruffles and romantic type of vibe. I've already seen a bunch of people wearing this. This is very Y2K inspired. This 2P set gives off that romantic type of vibe but it is kind of transparent and it has the ruffle. This is also a really cute option as a cover up too. I always remember that fashion is for fun and you don't have to add every trend into your closet.," Spring trends, worth of denim accessories are gonna be everywhere, especially in shoes and bags and I love it We're also going to see lace make a huge return. I've actually been missing lace So I'm excited for this gas stations on ease will be back We're also gonna see crop trench coats everywhere We don't often see black bags for spring and summer and an effort to be more sustainable We're gonna see where people carry their black bags through the warmer months We're also seeing a lot of seashell details. It's so adorable and perfect for spring I love this clutch from Etsy like for the next part"," Let's talk winter fashion staples that you're gonna want to get your hands on. Unless you're living under a rock, you know that these uggs have had a chokehold on every female and some males. They really are so cute and I feel like they make any look, just kind of look a little more casual but not in like a way, like in a cool way, you know, and that's actually kind of hard to do. And if you don't like or can't find those anywhere, I ended up getting my hands on the Ugg-Taz slippers. I'm obsessed with them. I've been wearing them with every outfit. Again, I feel like they make like kind of a more formal outfit like I have on here, a little more casual but in a cool way. Next up is chunky scarves. I live for the chunky scarves. I feel like this is a trend that's been around for years. It's functional, it's warm. I think what I love about accessories like this is that she was on a pretty simple outfit, leather jacket, plain jeans, hairs up, looks like minimal makeup, but she ended up scarf and she just looks like she put more effort in. You know what I'm saying? That's what we like with outfits guys. You like to add just little accessories that just elevate your style. Love them. Next we have leg warmers. This is a very controversial one. I feel like people either love them or they hate them. I personally love them. I think they look cute. And if you are like a mini skirt girl in the winter, but don't want to be so so cold, great option. Leg warmers. Like with the tights, I've also been seeing these gorgeous vintage moto jackets. I think that's what they're called. I'm not sure. I've been seeing them everywhere. I physically need one. I think they're so cool. They kind of play off of that oversized leather jacket trend that was huge for fall. I feel like this is kind of like an edgier, cooler, funner, elevated way to do the style for winter. We still love the oversized leather jackets though. I thrifted one and I wear it all the time. That's a great place to get them is with thrift stores. I got mine from the men's section. Like they just look so cool, so timeless, very 90s. Like I love outfits like this where she just has on a simple little fitted dress, oversized jacket and some slim little boots. Ooh, I live for it. It's so good and so easy. And this jacket is something you will have in your closet for years. One I've been loving lately is these like fitted little sweaters that are kind of like ending a little low like your hip line, kind of like fran fine vibes. I just wore one the other day and I felt so cool in it. There's me from the other day and mine, I know it's not exactly the same, but just like the way the longer shirt laid over the mini skirt. Oh, it was like such a vibe. I really need to invest in other items like this. Also boots like this are a must for winter. I have worn these Vince commuter ones with every single outfit. Oh, I'm running out of time. Let me know if you guys want a part two."," Let's talk fall jacket trends 2022. And I know that I've been gone for a while and this light looks creepy, but I promise I'm not kidnapped. I've just been a bit busy lately. And also before we get into this, I just want to say that all of these fall jacket trends are staples. So no matter which one you choose, you just can't do anything wrong. So first up we have, whether you like it or not, the blazer. Plad is a color that comes back every single fall. So if you want to spice up your blazer look, you can go for a plaid blazer. Or just go to safe route and go for a neutral one. Next up we have biker and leather jackets. Which I think is going to be huge this fall. Any people have been saying that the tumbler grunge style is coming back. So that's why I think especially leather jackets is going to be big this year. Then we have trench coats which is a classic. Bombard jackets are also making a comeback especially the ones with a collar."," trending patterns for summer 2022 from a fashion major. First up, we have the newspaper print like this. We've already been seeing this one a lot. It's gonna be huge. My personal favorite is what I like to call the postcard pattern. It's exactly what it sounds like. Just looks like it has a bunch of cute little postcards all over it. Or just kind of like that abstract postcard aesthetic. If you know what I mean. The girls that get it, get it, he gets it. We're seeing lots of prints like this. Kind of going without just lots of abstract prints like this. And graphic prints like this. Next up, very geometric abstract prints like this. Can you see the theme? Abstract. Speaking of abstract, lots like this. Lots of watercolor-esque prints like this. We're still seeing the gingham print and the checkered print. But I'm seeing it a bit more like this. Or like this. I still have a lot. Let me know if you all want a part two."," Hi. Boy, do we have a lot to talk about. Thank you so much for commenting this because let me tell you, I could make probably a dozen videos right now. But we'll start with one. Hi, my name is Hannah. I'm a retail buyer for a few boutiques and I want to talk about what is going to be in for spring 2022. We're not going to waste a lot of time. I want to get right into it. But I have to say this is probably the most chaotic trend prediction I have seen in a long time. Starting really strong for this spring color. And I'm not just talking about like the sweet pastel colors that we usually see for spring. I'm talking about all color all the time, everywhere combined together, color blocking, all kinds of color. I've talked about this a little bit before, but I think people are just so fed up with being inside. You're going to get a lot of this like chaotic, we don't care maximalist type of dressing this spring. And honestly, I think it's going to go all year long. L Magazine literally labeled this type of trend as dopamine dressing. Versace did this look in their 2022 spring runway and I love this color combination. I think we're going to see it a lot. We've seen it a little bit before, but I think it's going to be huge. All the really pretty warm tones, the oranges, the reds, the pinks. I think it goes really well with every skin tone. This is one of Valentino's looks. This Cerulean blue I saw a ton. Oh my word. It's beautiful. Yes, this Cerulean blue and devilish product. I think one of my favorite runway shows this year was LeCost. This is a screenshot of some of their looks and I really think they blended this wild color movement so well. You can see a lot of the deep muted colors like the dark greens and the broons, but they also have like the pop of turquoise and the really pale pink. I think they're all fantastic. Pantone released their color of the year, which is this really pretty purple and they're calling it very peri, very peri-win goal. I've seen a lot of designers bringing this purple in and I think it looks really good. I like from pants to bringing it in in all little details like the shoes, the makeup, the hair accessories, all that stuff. This is also one of my favorite looks and I think it's going to be so fun this spring. Combining the same color in different tones. Gucci paired this very yellow kind of crazy green with a very classy sleek teal green and I just love it. I think you're going to see a lot of people experimenting with color this spring into the summer. So just try anything. Why not? Because Gucci pulled it off. I mean, and yes, green is also going to be a huge color. This is Brandon Maxwell. Killed it. This is Mosquito in this like yellowy neon green. It's beautiful. This is also Mosquito. Gigi Hadid walked in their show and I just, I think we need to talk about it next time. Just the whole baby thing, you know. I don't know. I'm out of time and there's so much more so like for part two."," Here is all pipe code to use this letter. Before I continue, do not forget to follow.", Okay guys these are going to be trends from last year that are going to follow us into Fall 2021 from a fashion major. Part 3. First up the puffer jacket. I got so many questions about this one specifically the Eritzia. Don't worry they are still very much in this year and they can be styled so many different ways. And I think we're going to be seeing it done in a lot of different and new colors. Green has just been the eight color this year and it's not going anywhere. Kelly Green is going to be the color this fall. Let's talk about the puffy leather that we've been seeing in a lot of shoes and bags this year. It's definitely going to follow us into Fall. But I think we're going to be seeing it more in handbags. You know we love our coach pillow. Speaking of coach they have just had the biggest comeback this year. We're definitely going to be seeing a lot more especially their bags. We saw a lot of these knee-high boots last winter. Knee-high boots are here to stay. I think we're going to be seeing them done a lot more in flat chunky ones like these. We have been loving silk button ups this year. We're going to be seeing a lot over size this fall. And the flannel is not going anywhere. It wouldn't be fall without her.," Here are some pants that I recommend you get from me clothes for summer and if you're short This video is great for you because I am 5'1 and I love these pants to death I have them with me so you're gonna see what it's like trident first We have my favorite and it is their crepe jersey straight pants for me. It's true to size I bought the blue ones, but look how cute they are We also have pockets and the fabric is very flowy So it's super comfortable. My second favorite they're long denim shorts Also, you want to size down for these ones. Here is the blue one and the white one Next are the cotton tapered pants. I quickly threw something on just to show you what I'd wear with it But honestly these could go with anything"," The Spring Trends, or the specific Rotten Boatop, has my name written all over it. I have a credit card no shame, I'm waiting for the restock. If I'm not wearing this top at the beach this summer, I don't want it. Will with John ever restock this. Need it in my life and I'm gonna cry if I don't get it. I don't know why I want to pay $80 for an inside out top, but I do. I blame Matilda. Like for the next part.",,,,
," Here are the top five fashion trends we should be expecting this spring and summer. How my name is Aisha and my goal here is to help you elevate your look from head to toe. I want you guys to look exquisite. Okay, like straight money. If you haven't noticed already color is back and better than ever. We're going to see a lot more color blocking outfits and outfits with pop of colors. So this one right here is a few pieces from the Jacques Mouk collection called this Liss Blash collection I believe and yeah it's beautiful. The lavender, the pink together. It's just, um, chef's kiss. Here's another example of that pop of color. We have two beautifully coordinated outfits. We have the blue, the bright orange and the fact that it ties in with the neutrals, it just kind of tones it down in a different way. So I love this. Here's another example. Just gorgeous. And for all my girls who don't have a lot of color in their wardrobe already, this is a perfect example of how you can have an all black outfit and all you need is an accessory that has a pop of color and automatically adjusts you up and elevates the look as you can see. So that's perfect."," Five trends we're absolutely doing this spring. Boxy silhouettes. And we may see this and perceive it as not the most flattering. If you pair this with the right accessories, it looks so shey and so polished. Fun denim. I really do think this speaks for itself. Whether it's an interesting embellishment or the shape of the jeans itself, have a little fun with it. A sweater layered with a white tee. It's gonna do it for me every single time. Stripes. Whether it's a classic half set or on your track pants, it's a great way to look equally timeless and untranslapered pants. They're fun and they're surprisingly versatile."," This is your sign that you need to up your fashion game this winter. These are a few things that you could do to elevate your look. At with it, the girls are wearing ties now. Experiment, it's fun. Who cares? She looks dope. Don't you want to look like that? I think this is just such a fun alternative for a belt. Fashion is all about going out of your comfort zone. After looking at this picture, I think I'm going to have to go buy myself a skinny scarf. Not necessarily the most practical, but the long pants are really cool. I'm sorry, this is giving fashionably chic house arrest. I'm totally putting an necklace on my bag."," Things in fashion I think would be trending in 2024. Not following trends. Hear me out. Coca, clean girl aesthetic, mob wife, strawberry makeup, whatever. With being teased. So many aesthetics, so many styles, so many trends. I'm getting tired of it for several reasons. One, it is financially impossible to keep up with every single trend. People tend to feel less authentic because they're just following trends and not really developing their own personal style. That massive production and conception is also really bad environmentally. So there are several different reasons. White people are tired of following trends. I personally feel like this trend of rejecting trends and embracing more personality and personal style. Something really good, especially for younger people. It helps them figuring out what they actually like. As someone who's passionate about fashion, I am very excited to see what 2024 would bring in terms of fashion."," Women's wear trends for 2024. The first item we have is a drop waist. Mostly in like mini dresses, we had the skirts sort of sits a little bit lower than the waist. We're seeing these all over the runway and they're super popular. The next one is leopard print, if you haven't been living under a rocket, already know about this. This features the print in any sort of style and bag, jewelry, skirt, shoes, as well as your traditional fur as well. The final item we have are these like off the shoulder tops. They sort of come like in the knit sort of style, but also lace print to be quite popular as well."," Spring 2024 fashion trends from a fashion stylist, it's gonna be a good one. First up, we are talking denim. Almost every season designers are finding new ways to reinvent denim or resurrect older styles, whether it's umbrella like this or bleach dyed printing like this. Of course, they're matching sets with texture. There are also newer styles with ornate detailing, fringe and unexpected places, and of course, embellishments. Next up, we are talking all things sporting. Last spring, it was all about the soccer jerseys. The season, they're gonna be swapped out for more of a rugby look, including elevated styles with sequins. Gucci proved that you cannot go wrong with a classic gray hoodie. I had never heard of this brand before, but they are officially iconic in my book. They styled soccer cleats. Soccer cleats."," This is what's gonna be trending this winter from a fashion stylist. Lofas were big last year and I definitely think they're gonna continue into this season. And on the topic of shoes, I feel like we're gonna see lots of new hybrids, especially like gumboot new hybrids. I'm actually obsessed with this trend and I think they are so cute. Now, the one that was around last season, I definitely think blazes will stay in trend this season as well. This is one I've already seen haves around Melbourne, but Maxi skirts, especially Denna Maxi skirts. They have already been big this year and I think the trend will definitely continue on into the colder seasons. I definitely feel like we're gonna see lots of blazes and hoody combos as well. I think this trend is so cute and a little way to kind of dress down your outfit without dressing it down, if that makes sense. This looks classy and chic. Honkiniets, I feel like are also gonna be huge this year. I think we'll definitely be seeing a lot of these. Let me know your favourite winter fashion trends in the comments and what you're excited to see this year from winter fashion."," Last talk 2023, fall fashion trends. Far scream will definitely be trending this season. Leather jackets, pants, bags, shoes, tops, whatever. Perfect if you wanna incorporate a pop of color in your look. We'll be seeing lots of suede pieces like these boots, bags like this, or coats like this. Still talking about beige. Cream and white jeans are gonna be super in. Something like this, this, or this right here. Cherry red will be super big this season as well. This outfit is the perfect autumn outfit. White pants, heated leather jacket, and a cherry red pop of color. Also this, our screen, aged in the cherry red. Perfection. Adding a pop of color in the shoes or in the bag is the way. Let me know if you wanna part two.", Let's talk about some of the biggest summer trends that we are seeing this year. First is boxer style shorts. These are replacing denim shorts this year and they are so comfortable and can be styled in so many ways. Next is a denim midi skirt and these are great for being dressed up or dressed down and if they're styled correctly they can look so chic. Next is a 90s inspired slip dress. These have never really gone out of style but they are a perfect summer classic. Next is sheer tops or just sheer in general. This is a huge trend right now and summer is the perfect time to jump on this.," Seven of the hottest spring fashion trends for 2023. Let's get into it. Now some of these trends are really not gonna last and some of them really well. So you're gonna wanna stick around. Number one, the long leather trench coat. Specifically in black now, this is not something new. There are many people that wear this and this is their aesthetic. But in terms of what's hot and trending in fashion, this is becoming a lot more mainstream. Especially when you start seeing, you know, a lot of the TikTok release wearing it and you see 10 variations on Zara. That's when you know it's kind of become a mainstream trend. It is very hot. It will continue for a couple seasons more but I don't think you should spend a fortune on the leather version and I also don't think you should spend anything on the plastic fast fashion version. If you love it and it's worth it for you, then definitely you should get it. Number two, we have denim on denim. Specifically denim suits, oversized denim blazers with matching denim pants and just generally denim. Lots of denim, denim on denim. In this photo, a good transition to number three, which is floral, apple case, just like flower details on everything. This is something I first saw with Magda Boutram. This is kind of like her aesthetic for the last few seasons and I feel like it's becoming more mainstream. I don't think that this is going to last that long. So I really don't think you should spend so much money on a leather flower choker by Saint Laurent because this is kind of more like a fad. I really don't think this is going to carry over for many more seasons. I think at the end of the day, and I say this with everything, if you love something, you should rock it, whether it's in style or not. But if you want to be on trend and you kind of like what's happening right now and you like to be current, this does seem like it will date by the next season. Number four, more low-key, quiet, and conspicuous fashion, which I did touch on a couple of videos ago. This is going to be a big trend now and going forward. This has been going on already. It's going to continue going on more and more. I think people will be less inclined to wear big in your face logos like the Alexander McKaylay era of Gucci and kind of be more subdued, more quiet with their fashion. The rich still rich still spending money more on brands like Cuchinelli, Laura Piano. Just think in general, people's aesthetics, whether it's no brand or name brand is going to be more understated and conspicuous fashion. Number five, big bags, bigger bags, really big bags, which I've been talking about for at least a couple seasons already and I said they're coming back. They're pretty much back, but still kind of trickling along, not quite super mainstream, but you will see more and more big bags going forward. Spring 2023, on to fall winter and on to the next season and season after that, because this is going to be a lasting trend. Do you guys know I'm Olsen Twin era for life, so I am so into this. Cargo pants very much still a thing, so I don't even want to talk about it that much, but I will say cargo shorts, Bermuda cargo shorts, very hot trend coming through, but this is really not going to work for everyone. I know sometimes you guys don't like to hear it, but someone like me who's five three, I could never wear this trend because this really is made for the tall girlies. I'm so sorry, love it though. Cargo pants though, we love those for everybody and you're going to see so many variations of Cargo pants in different ways, vibrant colors, denim of course, silky satins, different fabrics, just like a good, very wearable trend. And number seven, long loose pleated puddled slacks. I love this trend, very kind of androgynous for the girlies kind of gender neutral, great trend for everybody across the board. It's a cool different take on like a casual baggy denim. It's just a little more elevated, still very casual, can dress it up, can dress it down. We'll last a few seasons, love this trend so much. That's it for today, my children. Make sure you follow because I do videos like this all the time and hit me up on Instagram because that's where I could be found in case, you know, I love it kids."," Let's talk winter 22 thousand trends and where to buy them. First, suit sets, especially three-piece suits like this. Even these suit inspired sets. This one's from the brand 4th and reckless. A lot of pinstripes as well this season. And you can mix and match suit sets, like a vest with pants. Or do a blazer in a skirt like this, it's from the brand line-S. They also have a pants suit option that I love. Next, leather jackets. I know leather for winter or groundbreaking. But specifically this year more edgy vintage jackets. Like this to stress one from all saints. And not just black jackets. These leather racing jackets are very trendy. This one from Elfric Eden, it's faux leather and it's detachable. So you can unzip the bottom half and turn it into a skirt. Pretty cool. Lots more winter trends to talk about so follow the pipe too."," 2022 trend predictions based on Haley Bieber's Instagram. I think we're gonna be seeing a lot of eyes blue this year. White T's are a staple. I think they're definitely going to trend for fall. He saw so many on the runway, and they're so versatile, it just makes sense. I think we're gonna see a lot of oversized flower pieces. A lot of Carrie Bradshaw. Haley makes me think of Sackspots, and I love it. Red Nails are a staple. Haley is so influential with her manicures, so I think this will be the it manicure for fall. Also, I think we're gonna see clip-ons, earrings that look like clip-ons."," hottest trends of summer 2022 from a fashion major. Part two. First up we have lots of network and tops and dresses basically and everything. Next up, duh, y'all already know corsets. I'm seeing a lot especially with lots of lace or with a flatter boning structure like this. For this, next up we have lots of denim and in a mountain of next up we have dicky's pants. Like these, especially with the fold. Next up, y'all already know what cutouts. Like this, for this, these aren't going anywhere. Kind of similar to that, lots of strappy detailing. Like this, next up, color-clashing. Like this, I'm especially seeing a lot with different variations of pink, green and orange and lots of pink and yellow too. I still got more lemmino if you want to part three."," Spring and Summer 2022 fashion trends from, you already know, a fashion major. Part 2. We already know about low-rise jeans, but are you ready for? Low-rise and mid-rise skirts. We're also going to be seeing a lot of midi and maxi skirts, especially in knit. We've already been seeing a lot of this specific neckline. We're going to be seeing it incorporated into much more casual pieces. Some of our favorite staples are going to be really big this season, like trousers, a good-o button up, and yes, the blazer, especially the blazer dress combo. We're also going to be seeing a lot of cropped blazer sets, both in skirts and with pants. Very similar to the police say, we're going to be seeing a lot of the crinkle or textured fabric, and a lot of ruffles like this. Also, this pale yellow color is just, I think it's going to be huge this spring and summer. Like for Part 3."," Let's talk about winter fashion trends and which ones you should be thrifting, investing in, or skipping altogether. All my opinion, of course. The good old onesie. In theory, I like love this trend, but in reality, where the fuck am I gonna wear? Something like this. To the office? Brandon, I'm not going into the office yet, but still, I can't walk in with my full ass crack on display, it ain't happening. So unfortunately, given I don't live the life of Kim Kay or Beyonce, this is a skip for me. My goal in life is to hide my cleavage forever and always, and I love a low-key sexy look, which is why I'm all about the cutout trend. Love the cutouts and the shoulders and the waist and the hips, such a low-key sexy vibe, and I'm here for it. I haven't been lucky enough to find this trend at the thrift, so I recommend investing in this one. Literally my dream is to be an 80's queen. So all about the metallic trend and going all out, whether it suits, trenches, pants, like you name it, metallic, everything is amazing. How do we recommend it? And this is definitely a trend you could find at the thrift store because there's so many 80's and 90's gems to be found. In case you didn't know, this thing is called a balaclava. And I think we can all agree that it's super creepy and suspicious to speak. I live in Chicago and we have like card jackings happening in broad daylight. So the last thing I need is confusion as to whether or not I'm the one stealing the cars down the block. Hard pass for me."," Okay, so I'm a buyer for a few local boutiques and I've been to some wholesale apparel trade shows in the past few weeks, so I'm going to show you what's going to be in for this fall. Let's get started. Okay, so you know how everyone says you can't wear white after Labor Day. So like, you can, guys, winter whites and creams. Look! Guys, I'm talking all whites, all creams. Even the same shade tone, you can wear it all. It's all going to be in. Get your whites, get your creams. You can wear white jeans after Labor Day, I promise. It's going to be okay. I mean, I literally look at her. She's, yep, all whites. Just, you're good. Okay, this whole situation we have to talk about. I have seen so many people talk about this on TikTok and they are right. This wide leg, like, business trouser pant is just stunning. Oh my gosh. It's just gorgeous. This high-waisted business look and you can pair with a blazer too. Like, this is just beautiful and it's not going out anytime soon. I love it. So classy. I just, with the blazer, shut up. And even like this thin leg too, it's just beautiful. Like, classic pleated pant. It's not going away. It's timeless. They're gorgeous. Okay, this is another fun one. So, pantone released these few color palettes a few weeks ago. Yeah, September 1st, they released the color palette for fall and look at them, guys. It's gorgeous. A lot of times you'll see like these creams and browns and especially this olive green that's kind of become like more of a staple fall color. But these colors are so exciting and I saw a lot of color at these market trade shows. I saw them months ago and I was like, surely that's not going into fall. And it is. Let me show you. Okay, one of the colors on there was this purple. Oh my gosh. Look at that, that lilac and again with the business trouser pant, it's stunning. So, again, with the scourges purple and it's kind of got like some pink undertones. It's more muted. I saw these two colors. It's almost like a mavi purple. I saw this a lot. It's just gorgeous. I'm going to have to make a part too because I have so many of these. But like this, this satin silky look, again with the business look too. The silk is everywhere. The matching set thing is just totally a thing. Even just the stunning casual look, like with a jean. And again with this like muted mauve color, it's just gorgeous. Again with a jean. Okay, so in April, Vogue released their 2021 fall trends and this was the number one thing on their list. Colage therapy is what it's called. It's also like patchwork, beautiful art pieces that you can wear, like that are on clothes. I need to touch more on this and there's so many other things I need to talk about. So I'm going to do a part two because there's just too much."," friends, here's some of my favorite summer 2021 trends part one. Hulter tops are super big this year as we re-energize retro aesthetics. Bonus points if it's in a colorful hue. Remuda shorts trump bootie shorts this season as a far more comfortable and channel cool girl energy. Next up are colorfully bold midi or maxi dresses. Large floral, tie-dye and other lads prints give this class sex a lot of youthful energy. Perfect for vacation. Finally are the ever so easy matching sets. Whether it's an athletic shortset or a funky skirt set for the beach, there's something so effortless about them. Follow for part two!",,,,,
,," Spring fashion trends, spring 2025, part two. Number one, nautical coastal vibes. This is of course a Nancy Myers inspired and this has been my summer spring uniform for the past two years and it's my two look. I'm always wearing a breezy oversized linen shirt and then stung it with a pair of white linen pants and I'm out the door. Feel like you always look chic and put together. Number two, textured layers. I've come across so many different outfit combinations of patterns and fabrics coming together and I just love how fun and springy it looks. I don't want to incorporate more fabrics and color into my wardrobe so I'm definitely feeling inspired by the strand. Number three, another pastel color, light pink. This is something I don't have in my wardrobe and I don't know if I will add it in. I do love the fresh and light vibe it brings spring wardrobe.", Winter outfit combos to wear when you don't know what to wear. The first combination we have is a hoodie underneath here that a trench or a blazer. I think this is a great way to incorporate comfort into your outfit that's still really elevated. You compare it with black pant or even joggers and look still really cool. The next is a double denim. I think a darker denim looks a bit more elevated and equally you can also pair this with a skirt. It's a great way to be able to lay a jumpers underneath a thing that's to keep you warm. And here's a collider denim version. The next is cardigan skirts and boots. It's great because you can lay it with tights and equally you don't want to do a boot and marry Jane or ballet farts are really cool. There's a really chic combination that you probably have in your closet.," Stop lying, you're yourself by saying you have nothing to wear. I'm going to show you a few outfits you can definitely recreate. Don't be overwhelmed by your own wardrobe. Number one, so simple, white tea, sneakers, and a matching blazer and pant. Can't mess it up and it always looks good. It's the same exact look, but a different font. Understanding what colors work well together will also help you. This brown looks great with a screen. Your knot ends are like a structured blazer look and this is a great sporty look. Now on the opposite end of the spectrum, try matching your dress and your jacket next time you go out. Since we're talking about what to wear, having your nails done is always important. We're definitely not moving fashion mountains with this deep red or anything, but it's always standard issue. Other red nails, but not a red ballet flat, let's maybe try and find red somewhere else like a leather jacket. Then it's a little red bag with a cheetah moment looks good together."," Now that you've had some time to get over the skinny jeans being out, this is part two of trends we were seeing less of in 2024. The first one is low-waisted pants. I'm sorry, Gen Z low-rise pants tried to have a moment in 2023 but failed and they're already on their way out in 2024. Instead we'll be seeing high-rise pants everywhere. Very happy about that because high-waisted pants are much more flattering. The second trend that we will be seeing less of is the unbalanced oversized look. I'm talking about oversized head-to-toe where you're literally drowning in the fabric. Instead we'll be seeing more balanced oversized silhouettes with a focus on highlighting the waist. And you can do this by pairing an oversized item with a more fitted one or adding a belt to send your waist. Next trend that we'll be fading away is the chunky sneakers and sandals. I feel like this was overdone and it's time to say goodbye. Instead we've been shifting towards sneakers with a more streamlined base and sandals that are flat or ballerinas. The last trend that we'll be leaving us is the cutouts. We've seen this a lot over the past few years and the pants, shoulders or rip cutouts. Instead we'll be seeing more office shoulder tops and asymmetrical ones that are more sophisticated. So which trend are you happy is finally out? Let me know.", the cool girls will be wearing this spring. The real cool girls not gonna get rid of her teeth issues just because it was trending last year. So definitely we see and did this choose this spring but some fun colors like this. Another cool girl essential for spring are the ballerina fl- and also some blanetose link that's perfect if you don't want to wear heels.," Let's talk winter 2023 fashion trends. I'm gonna be seeing a lot of bows and ribbons this season. A lot of people are getting creative tying them to bags, putting them in their hair, using accessories, bow earrings, tying them to their shoes. Like this, this, and this. As predicted, first going nowhere this winter, we're gonna be seeing it a lot in coats, as well as trims. Like this, this or this. I'm obsessed with the little trim around the collar and the sleeves, I think that's really unique. We saw it last year too. And yes, red is going nowhere. We're gonna be seeing it a lot this season in tights. Colored tights are in. We're gonna be seeing them like this, this or this. And this is a really cute way to add color. Her outfit is otherwise completely neutral, but adding the pop of pink makes it really cute. This fall, we saw the rise of Mary Jane's and Ballet Flats. And we're bringing them into winter by adding socks. This is another way you can get creative with your accessories this winter by adding a pop of color or a design or a texture. And I think it's a really unique way to play with winter fashion. And let's not forget about our tried and true Sherpa. Sherpa has been a staple for winter for years now, and we're gonna be seeing it a lot again in accessories and jackets. Perhaps the most popular way we're seeing Sherpa this season is in the Tasman Uggboot slippers. They are so cute. I love how she styled it here with the Sherpa and the jacket as well. I would not be surprised if I saw a lot of jackets like this this season too. The red Sherpa, never seen that before, so cute. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more of it this season and be sure to follow for more."," Part three of Fall 2023 runway recap. I'm gonna go over all of the big and little trends that came out of the fashion shows this year. What you need to add to your closet for this fall and what might have already been around and that's not going anywhere. First up, the color cherry red. Cherry red is the color of Fall 2023. Pay attention to it. This color was on almost every single designer's runway show. This one specifically is Fendi. Fendi did incredible things with draping this season and this color red was a big must. One more for Fendi because this is so gorgeous. Bright cherry red love. Valentina with the menswear, cherry red, gorgeous. Jason Wu absolutely slanging cherry red we love. Also go back and watch my recap of the Jacques Mise show in Versailles. First of all, it's amazing. Second of all, literal cherries on a key chain. He also did cherry necklaces. It does not get more obvious than this. Cherry red, believe it. Next up is Midi. Midi Hems, Midi dresses, Midi pants. We are seeing everything. Midi, I know a lot of you are gonna have a lot to say about this but here we have Jason Wu with the Midi dresses. These were on every runway. Jason Wu, not with the super obvious midi here but it's still ankle cut so we're not gonna call that a maxi and it's Midi and we love it. This is also pretty gothic too for Jason Wu which is a big homage to Vivian Westwood. Go back to the previous videos to get the whole rundown on that trend. This drape look is obviously fendy and once again, Midi cut on the bottom. Gorgeous. I think that we've been seeing a lot of those kind of midi skirts with the tall boots underneath. I love it. I'm actually obsessed. Boat take a banana with us as well. The Midi Hems with the tall boots underneath. Gorgeous. One more for good measure. Coach out here with the Midi Hems and the tall boots. We love. Next up another hot topic, flats. Everyone is wearing flats this year. Like the typical ballet flats that I personally haven't worn since I don't know middle school. They're back. I'm not sure how I feel about it but it's happening. Miss Kaya Gerber absolutely slaying for Valentino in flats. Wild. Okay, it's honestly so hard to get a picture from the runway of models wearing flats but once again, flats. This is the Fendi show. Just believe it. It's happening. Ballerina flats are very in right now. Okay, come back for more. We're gonna get into more of the accessories and micro trends starting with skinny belts."," You need to know about the trending mermaid core aesthetic. I am self-proclaimed CEO of the healthy successful Beach Home and Lifestyle. Needless to say, I just feel like this trend is written all over my body and yes I don't work at Vogue, but I do have 14,000 pictures saved on my Pinterest board, which is called elevated healthy Beach Home on. It is just my moral obligation to share this so that you can just show up as your healthy elevated Beach Home this summer Basque in your feminine energy and just glow so hard both in and outside the water You can just room it since you're somewhere to the max and yes, I know I'm talking about outer appearance and that's not everything Let me tell you if you just put in a little bit more effort to make you feel like your best self It will make a difference. So let's get into it this part one I'm going to be discussing everything fashion and outfit wise. Let's get into it first up Is anything knitted or crochet and if you feel like this trend is not for you Think again because there's so many different ways in which you can combine it. You can do sets You can do a little cute like shrugs. You can do skirts You can wear to the beach, but you can also repurpose it after the summer is over and wear it in fall I just feel like this whole trend screams mermaid. This woman literally looks like a real life mermaid So I feel like there is no reason a knot to kind of tune to that and play around with different like densities of knits How you wear how you style different colors next? We're going to hop on over more on the elevated side I feel like any dress that just screams like are you all glitter? Sheer shimmer vibe is just so feminine to me and give me mermaid vibes So you can definitely plan to that also if you're not going to super chic route You couldn't have so much on like the traditional mermaid colors I feel like anything that is like strapless plays into this trend so well as well as the two p sets I guess because you know mermaids have a little bra and then tail So definitely make sure you try any of these two last but not least is swimmer and for some reason I don't know why but the cobalt blue is just screaming mermaid vibes to me It makes your tampocs so well I actually own a color like that This is me and the next picture is me as well And I feel like it just gives you mermaid vibes You can also play into other colors like traditional like turquoise purple pink and so on last thing I just want to emphasize that everybody is a beach body Everybody is a mermaid body if you want to be also if this isn't proof what I was saying before in the intro of the video I don't know what is because this is literally like my vision board So have fun with all the outfits and make sure you fall along because I'm also the videos on jewelry nails accessories even activities and so on so stay tuned for that and fall along if you want to know everything about this"," Spring, 2020 fashion trends according to a New York City fashion sales. First up is colored soothing. It's all green at Stella McCartney, yellow at Oola Johnson. Sleepless best option like this. Very cool and probably makes more sense for the weather. Cannot forget skirt soothing as well. Next up is the undressed dressed upload. The corset trend is getting a little played out. You love this option. It's been, it's flowy. It's not your classic super tight fitted corset. Chanel showed this trend as a pair of sheer pajama-esque pants. Love that they paired it with the blazers not as revealing as some of the other options."," These will be the hot trends of winter 2022. French, something that's always been around, but gaining more and more popularity at the forefront of many designers' collections. Very edgy rock and roll style with leathers and different fabrics and silhouettes. Also a completely different way of modern day flapper. And while this is gaining popularity on the runway for the last few seasons, it's proving to go really strong into 2022. Next, we have cutouts continuing to go strong but each season getting more and more risqué and daring. Not just cutouts of the mid-drift anymore. We will be seeing more unexpected cutouts and little peep shows in 2022. Plad reinvented so many different styles and aesthetics yet the presence has been consistent on the runway. So many ways to incorporate this into your wardrobe. Last for today, we have odd oversized knits, shredded and disheveled, long and oversized. Definitely one of those trends you'll love or you'll hate. That's it for now, kids. Daily fashion on my Instagram. I'll see you there."," all shoot trends and how to style them. Go ahead and save this. Obviously these are coming back for another here. As are these. I would actually style them very similarly like this, this, and this. Over the knee boots are bad but instead of styling them like this or this, try something like this, this, or this. We already talked about these but as a refresher I would style them like this, this, for this. Let me know if you're in a part two."," These are the hottest trends for summer 2022 from a fashion major. First up, we have tube tops like this. These are gonna be one of the hottest trend sets summer. Going with that also tube top or strapless dresses. Both short and long. We're seeing them a lot in matching sets too. We're seeing a lot of cardopants, especially baggy or oversized cardopants. This is another one that I think is just gonna be so hot. Next up is Peplum or ballerina style tops like this or like this. I think they're so cute. I know y'all are sick if you're gonna be talk about it, but slow rise. Y'all already know we are loving crochet. Anything and everything. In accessories and especially as cover ups. We're still seeing a lot of longer shorts like this or like this. Last but not least, platform sandals. Lots of platform slides and platform flip-flops. Let me know if y'all want a part two. I still have a lot.", Neutrals are over. Here's what you're gonna be wearing instead. Orange is gonna be the it color for spring And we're gonna be seeing a lot of crazy color combos like purple pink and just other citrusy pairings We all know that green was a nit color last year Now we're moving on to a little more electric version with line made. This color works great with basics Makes bold patterns pop even more and looks beautiful paired with lavender Pastel yellow is gonna be a hit. It'll look phenomenal with monochromatic versions like this and paired with baby blues and lilac Hit plus to part two," Fashion forecast 2021 if you want to be on top of the trends keep on watching. Okay, first up we have Whiteny High Boots. The brown pepper jacket everybody's obsessed with is here to stay. Gap sweatshirts, you know if Emma Chamberlain wore it, it's going to be a trend in 2021. I've been seeing these furry bags everywhere and I'm obsessed with them and you can find them on Amazon and Shea. And this one you can find in your dad's closet, brother's closet, and oversized blazer with shoulder pads."," Okay guys, these are gonna be trends from last year that are gonna follow us into fall 2021 from a fashion major I've already made a few videos for new fall trends But wanted to do one specifically for reoccurring trends and how to elevate it for this season. Let's go I mentioned that the preppy style is gonna take over this fall We saw a lot of this look last year and it's here to stay which luckily for us means sweater vest star two Especially styled with lots of layering. Let's talk about the chunky boot. We love them and they're not going anywhere This fall in winter we're gonna see them in a lot more colors and patterns and with much more detailing I have this exact pair from ASOS and they have done me so good We saw the fur trim sweater emerge at the end of last winter This year, that's gonna translate to fur trim coats and with how much we've been loving color all of 2021 Expect to see it in a lot of statement colors But they're gonna be everything and more neutrals too. Don't worry. Y'all already know we love the oversized blazer and they're not going anywhere Especially for preppy fits Same thing with the black leather blazer. It can be styled so many different ways. We have not seen the last of her"," I'm gonna show you two new ways to wear black this summer. Black button down, black shorts, black bikini, unbuttoned. Don't forget the black sandals, draw hats, what makes it? Yes. Cute! Silk top, silk skirt, white accessories. Um, right."," Logan Part 2 of Spring and Summer Trends and this time we're gonna be talking about patterns. I am so hyped for these patterns, you have no idea. I'm gonna start off with the one that I could maybe shed tears over. I think this is gonna be the absolute pattern of the summer, this Hawaiian flower print. Absolutely, but you take full while you kiddin' me love! I actually just bought a bathing suit off of Poshmark with this pattern and I'm so hyped. But come on, it's beautiful. It's the perfect mix of slightly vintage, slightly 2000. Honestly, it combines all my loves. I would say this is a more muted version, but I really like this floral. I love the colors in this one. But somebody please, tell me what flower this is because I love it. I just thrifted this shirt too, which I'm gonna be selling on my Instagram. But it's the perfect pattern. Also think these Hawaiian flowers are gonna be more adapted into just basic floral prints in general. This is giving me vintage spin of Lily Pulitzer, which I think is gonna be pretty in. Almost as a preppy vibe. It's like preppy vintage. It's so beautiful, I love it. Yeah.",,,,
,," So here are all the girl trends that you need to know about for 2025. My name's Ellen. I do train forecasting. The first term we're going to see is polka dots. Your simple polka dot print, like nothing more complicated than that. We'll see in all sort of accessories as well as clothes. I think this makes a really great addition for summer, especially the next term we have is off the shoulder tops, like this drape effect just screams summer vibes. I was at the most sophisticated ones like this as well. And finally, the return of the club rats sort of vibe, but still in a little more classy tone. So fur coats obviously still in, but we're seeing a pet like slip dresses and silk. And we're seeing a bit more of a disheveled looks with like Kate Moss messy hair vibes."," but cool girls will be wearing for winter 2024. Colorless jackets. Honestly, it was unsure about this trend at first, but I actually really like it. I think it adds a little bit of a cleaner look to the jacket. So cute with trousers and just a basic tee. Obsessed with how it looks with the turtle neck, Ella Clawba's, not only are they cute, but they're also very functional. Add such an easy fun layer. You can even go the extra mile and layer it with a baseball cap. Such a great way to elevate a very simple outfit, kind of like this. This girl had a leopard print, Bella Clawba with leopard print shoes. Another really good example. And I love how it elevates this already very chic outfit. White fur coats. This coat makes any outfit a statement. Easily elevates a very casual look. Alpha is definitely speaking to me. I really like how this particular jacket is like more of that longer fur style. Like white, you can also go for a fur coat that is more of like a beige kind of like this. Leather trench coats. Canvas styles have been really popular but are placing that with leather can really dress this with anything. Love going with a really simple fit, kind of like this. Brown is very trendy this year. So even better if the trench coat is brown."," Please just listen to everything I have to say and I promise you'll look cool this fall. Swade is going to be topping the charts. Not just normal Swade, but you see these embellishments? That's the key. Or you swade with a little bit of fringe. This is like a stupid good look. Even the hair, the matching denim set, like this brown is so effortlessly cool girl. Like who is she? If I saw her in the office, I would wanna be her friend immediately. And if you don't have a brown bag like this, like you're just not doing it right. It doesn't have to be botega. Like you don't have to drop an arm in a leg for this, but something along these lines. This stunning. See we're seeing the studs again. I told you this darker blue would pair perfectly with browns. The shoe, the bag, the jacket, cool. The hair, glossy, the tee, probably her boyfriend's. And I'm leaving you with this last look for Enzbo."," What cool girls will be wearing for summer 2024, part four, track shorts, and we're not gonna be seeing this with like, S-leisure combinations. Gonna be seeing them with very girly tops, belly flats, and also be seeing them paired with Mary Jane's. I love this. Looks so good with a cute cami top. Love this grand green combination. Love them also paired with cowboy boots, obsessed with this whole outfit. Puffsleeve tops specifically ones with front ties. Love this style paired with denim, and I really like how this girl also let the top little exposed in the front. Love it in a set. This set is gorgeous. If you don't like the multiple ties, you can go with something a little bit more dainty and a little bit less of a puffleeve. And if the other style is not as much of your thing, you can also go for more of a cropped style. I need this top right now. Fruit graphic teas. To me, these are replacing the banties that used to be so popular. Love how much color this adds to an outfit. Can be paired with so many different things, but I love a good box for sure. A great way to spice up denim. Sling boxes is such a great alternative if ballet flats aren't your vibe. I particularly like ones with a pointed toe, obsessed with the white and black combo. They go with anything and everything and spice up the most basic outfit. Like imagine this was just sneakers. It would be totally different. And I personally obsessed with loafers in this style."," really overwinter. Let's be honest, we all are. Ready to talk about spring fashion? It's for you. Red is not going anywhere. Most are going to see it in this bright, like, cherry red, especially just the pop of red with an accessories and the socks. It looks so good with denim. Red is also being paired with Cheetah print. Make it more classic or timeless. Go for a short jacket, this or this, as an accessory like this or this. Denim on denim is also so effortless for spring. In this season, you're going to see it paired a lot with a bright color. A sweater draped over, the bright bag. Love this color too. Look how fun are these shoes. You don't sleep on the bright socks either. This is so cute. Next, we're going to see a lot of maximalist jewelry. Those chunky charm necklaces are going to be everywhere, but also these bigger bangles. Look at how fun these colorful rings are, especially paired with these nails. Also goes great with a graphic tee, which you'll see paired a little unexpectedly, like with this silk skirt, oversized blazer, baggy jeans. You are definitely a cool girl if you're just like this. No ballet flats are a thing, but you're also going to see a lot of the loafers still. I'm actually paired with socks. For Mary Jane's, love this. It's giving effortless tomboy. As I think pops of this cold-bought blue are going to be everywhere. A bright, vibrant color for spring. That's not your typical pastown. It is so bright. I love the textured pieces. I go wrong pairing it with the white, or layered with a trench. Love this. Let me know if you want a part two and follow."," If you want to know what the girlies are wearing this winter but you have absolutely no desire to find those items at affordable prices, I got you covered. The last video I was very hesitant about the Brighton Stripes. But this is what I wore tonight. This one was tough. Okay, this one was tough. At least I've been doing this for three years full time. I know how to find good things. So much so that I think I might buy one of these. I think this really could be a winner. I might buy it. I'll let you know how it goes. Okay, I told y'all this one is doable. Silk skirts, they're a little extra but they are doable. Everything that I've been seeing, this is a casual look. For us average girlies, this is like dressed up but I'm picturing like t-shirt sneakers even. Like this, or this. And if you want to go dressed up, you could do something like this. Perfect to find on Amazon because we do not need something of quality here because this is a trend. Not saying you can't find good quality stuff on Amazon, I'm just saying don't shell out $100. Guys, this is doable. This is more of my style. I have the blazer right here. It's so cute. I promise I'm an average girly. This is like the most extra I've ever been. But I kind of look cute. This was the inspo. These are both the blazers. Such a doable look like a blazer and a sweatshirt and a baseball cap. I'm in. Another one that I think is very doable for the average girlies. Mini skirts and thick sweaters. One, no one has time for mini skirts. We need skirts, okay? I found some great options, mini skirts and skirts and I have all of these sweaters. Here's some inspo where I'm like perfect. This is how I try to pull it off, okay? I wear shorts. We don't need to follow it exactly. Red. She's wearing it as her main piece with her top, but I'm thinking red accessories. Boy did I find the best accessories. Everything is $100 or less. Your girl looked through the reviews. I would not steer you wrong. I could never, but maybe I could and I could definitely wear those."," I wanna talk about fall micro trends from the fall 2023 runway shows that we've seen. A lot of my past videos have been talking about the macro trends, what's sticking around, what you might already have in your closet that isn't going anywhere, but I wanna talk about some of the micro trends that we've been seeing. Before I get into it, the difference between a micro and a macro trend is very important. Here's macro trends are overarching themes that we see sticking around for years on end. This could be here for five to 10 years maybe. A micro trend is going to leave just as quickly as it comes. For example, a lot of micro trends going around right now are a lot of the cores that we're seeing. So Barbie core, mermaid core, a lot of those things come and go really quickly. And we're gonna see those on every runway as well. But there are a couple common themes across multiple different designers that we're gonna get into. First of which is colored tights. Micro trends are already so controversial. And I know that y'all are gonna have so much to say about this. This is Farragamo Fall 2023. So we're seeing colored tights in two ways. A, as a statement piece and B, as a full monochrome look. Here we have an example of the monochrome. I thought I would hate it. I don't hate it. I might love it. Next up we have Mewmew with the green tights. I kind of love it. I mean, I loved Mewmew's entire Fall 2023 show. The disheveled look of every model. Grunge mixed with the clasiness. Like, I'm pretty here for this. Gucci had a lot of colored tights on their Fall 2023 show. These are the red tights. And I kind of love this. I'm here for it. Another monochrome look. This is obviously Boatega Venata. And I like this. The tights definitely make sense. When it's a dressier look, you can't go wrong with that. One more from Mewmew. We are using these teal tights as a statement piece. And I don't know. It's another dressier look. So it's a little bit different from the rest of the collection. But I really like this. Okay, the other micro trend that we saw across a lot of renways this season are the skinny belts. This is the Gucci show and the skinny belts were all over their whole collection. Louis Vuitton with the skinny belts as well. On their Fall 2023 runway collection, you can see the way it hangs down like that. They're trying to harness that oversized look while still keeping the accessory itself very small and petite. Pro and Zashouler with the belt so small, this honestly could be a shoelace. And if you're me, I will literally use shoelace as sometimes as belt. I love this. Brandon Maxwell giving us a creative way to wear the skinny belt directly on the skin. I am so here for this one. And one more hanging look from Louis Vuitton. I love it. This is also giving us that hourglass figure that I've been talking about so much. Let me know what you guys think. And if you are here for these Fall 2023 micro trends and I'll be back with more. Bye."," Summer is finally here and we're gonna talk about specific clothing pieces that are trending right now. First one are Y-Gins, White for the summer. It's a must. They look so pretty together, so elevated. You can really play around with them, keeping it neutral or adding colors to your outfit. The next one are White Alinan and this one's also a must for the summer. With the all money and quite luxury aesthetic, this one's gonna be a must for the season. This next one is one of my favorites, which are Kidding Heels. Whether they are Sandal Heels or they are Pointe Heels Ruffles. This one comes a lot with a mermaid core. Adding just this ruffles to the dresses, to the tops, to the skirt. They look so feminine. Top's we're gonna be seeing two tops that are longer. Also, tops with a wider strap and also like a higher neck. And one strap or asymmetric straps. We lined your top where you have more upper legs, more feminine, more dainty top. Tader best are pretty much a must right now. At this point, they are a basic in our closet. Also, open back tops are super in right now. We will continue seeing low waisted bottoms and also having maxi skirts, which are like super flowy, super boho and also denim skirts. We're short to where we're gonna be seeing more of a longer short cowboy boots. You already know it. They have been in for a while. Necklaces with bigger pendants. I made a YouTube video talking about summer trends as well. If you wanna go and check that out, a link on the bio."," I have been researching spring fashion trends for the past couple of weeks. From the runways, the fashion publications, social media, in real life, and here are some of the trends. The flower, corsage trend, I've been obsessed with this for the past couple of seasons. It's beautiful on clothing, but it also makes such a great accessory, like a necklace, a pair of shoes, earrings. And I think this is a great way to do florals for spring without being too traditional. I love the doll core trend because it's youthful, it's joyful, it's fun and frilly. Just think cute, sweet doll house vibes. I'm also a sucker for texture, so I love the ruffles. Switching something to a little more edgy and structured, I love the motocross trend. Bella Hadid often wears this in her street style looks and it's a great place for inspo. Having a jacket like this is a great statement piece of spring. Next is trousers, trousers are theic girl. Like you are going to look like the most chic, fashionable person in these silky trousers. You could also have fun and do more of a bold statement pair. I'm running out of time, let me know if we want a part two."," Friends, here are a few winter 2022 fashion trends I'm predicting. Of course, leather pants, knitwear, and chunky boots will continue to rain to premium this winter. I know Puffer jackets are a season staple, but this year I predict that long line puffers will be all the rage. Oversized blanket scarves, especially eclectic checkered ones, will be the accessory of choice as well as fun earmuffs. Next up, we're still loving the pleated skirts and sweater dresses. This time, we're focusing on fun stockings and tights as well as edged up loafers. Gangnam and Houndstooth will remain must-have prints and berets will add a pop of color.

"," summer 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major. Part four. First up, we have the Coastal Grimmother aesthetic. I'm sure we've all heard about this one on TikTok by now, but if not, it's exactly what it sounds like. You go to the coast and you become a grandmother. Easy. But really, it's a lot of flowy fabrics, lots of butt-naps, lots of linen, lots of knit, draping a sweater over your shoulders, like this, lots of matching sets, like this, this, or this, and more. I've talked about this for a while, but go watch the Coastal Grimmother CEO's videos. It's cute. Next up, you'll already know the Dickey's pants. Absolute Acryl pantha season, I don't make the rules. Older waistline on these is a must. And you can get them at Walmart for $25 in the men's section. You'll know I have more, like, for part five.", Spring trends worth the trampolists and sweetheart tops are gonna be everywhere. This is one of my favorite trends. We're also gonna see a lot of ironic clothing. I know this isn't for everyone. I think it's really fun. Pop sleeves are coming back. I honestly love it. I think this is so sweet and cute. Think we'll be everywhere. Thank God. Think we're gonna see a lot of purple and pink together. That form converse or back. I think they're the perfect spring staple. I'm also really excited about Kamo Cargo's. Psych for the next part.," Winter trends for 2021, part three. Extreme fringe, really long dramatic fringe. Save the drama for your wardrobe baby because this is it. And this is not your typical fast fashion mini fringe dress. This is drama, this is fashion. Fashion. The naked undressed look still going very strong, but in a more dramatic way, like we're not even trying to hide the fact anymore that we're straight up wearing a bra. Like as a top. Here for it, very similar on Dolce Gabbana. Dolce Dolce. Can we say Dolce? Very controversial. But always has been their aesthetic. All right, my girl, last for part three. These shoulders. Look, man, I don't make the rules. I like drama with my fashion, but I like a little practicality as well. Are we about to blast off? What is happening? What is happening?"," Show us fashion trends for this fall and winter. Yes, I can. And let's talk about how style shorts fall. Because they're my favorite. Try to stay within denim shorts and go for a dress short or leather shorts. Layer a button down over your turtle neck to stay warm and add knee high boots. You can keep the look like this or you can bring it to the next level and add sweater. Option two. Parasil gear satin button down with loafers or oxford shoes. Finish the look with a headband blazer and handbag."," Hi, so if you didn't see my last video, I did talk about my dislike of summer 21 fashion fads. Some people asked me to go a little bit more in depth, so here I am, but I just want to remind you, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and to be able to take my opinion with a grain of salt, I feel like if something I dislike makes you confident when you wear it, I'm 4 to 100%. I believe fashion is subjective, it's meant to be challenged, and it's a conversation. So let's converse. But with that being said, I want to share what my alternatives are to the summer's fashion fads, and I'm going to make this a series. So the first summer 21 fashion fad I want to address are these platform thong sandals. Now I understand these have a lot of people nostalgic, but they were a fad before, and I think they're going to be a fad again. Now an alternative to these platform thong sandals would be a thong kitten heel, it gives you the height, and it sticks with a thong theme. I think the thong kitten heel is just a lot more timeless and a classic, and if you want, I can show you how to style them."," Stop scrolling. Do you like fashion style and being ahead of the trends before they take off? If so, stick around. If not, keep scrolling. Okay now that they're gone, I'm going to let you all in on the biggest fashion trends taking off this spring. Make sure you stay tuned to that end though because I'm sharing the biggest tip last. For my people that love a good pop of color, you are going to be obsessed with these spring trends. You can't go wrong with a neon handbag and green is definitely a color to watch. I've been seeing so many fashion bloggers accessorizing with neon green shoes, handbags, and sunnies. Oversized pastel blazers make for the perfect spring transitional piece. We'll be seeing a lot of simplistic slip dresses with breathable fabrics such as silk and satin. Right orange is another color to watch and we'll be seeing a lot of two piece sets with geometric patterns. My biggest style tip for spring 2021, we saw these start to emerge at the beginning of 2021 but beads are taking over. They make her perfect layering necklaces and amazing phone accessories. Hit that follow and let me know if you want a part too!",,,,
,," and fashion trends that are going to be huge in 2025, part one. Number one, Swade. It was a huge trend last year and it's back and bigger than ever. We're going to see Swade Jacket, Swade Cotes, Swade Blazers, Swade Scirts like this are going to be huge, not forgetting trainers and of course loafers. Number two is refined athletes you wear. Elevated comfy stables, a particular influence from softer sports like Palates and yoga. Number three, a huge trending color is going to be soft powdery pink, stepping away from the bright barbie core pink and leaning into a soft glender pink. This is a great one as we get into the spring summer. But you could start incorporating it now if you want to get ahead. Number four, bubble hens, particularly bubble hens skirts and dresses. I've already seen them creeping in over winter 24, but spring summer 25, I felt like we're really going to see this trend take over. Number five, maximalism. Quiet luxury dominated last year. We're now seeing its counterpart taking over the runways. This trend it's all about more is more."," This may be an unpopular opinion, but despite what influencers say, you don't need to buy a whole new wardrobe to stay stylish this season. By adding just a few new pieces, you can keep your wardrobe fresh while still making the most of what you already own. I'm Alice in the Batis, a personal stylist who's helped over 100,000 women stop overconsuming and start making the most of the clothes they already own, and I'm going to do the same for you this winter season. As I go through these winter trends, I want you to think about the ones you already own and which ones are going to actually complement what's already in your closet. Number one is fur coats. Leather fur is making a major comeback this winter, and it is such an easy way to add instant glam to any outfit. And if you've already got a faux fur jacket or vest hanging in your closet, now is the perfect time to pull it out and wear it. Trend number two is leather pants. Leather pants are huge this winter, but don't feel pressured to rush out and buy a new pair. Legging, skirts, and even faux leather options are a great way that you can stay on trend. Trend number three is leopard prints. Leopard is still going strong, and I for one am loving it. If you've already got a leopard blouse, a scarf, or pair of shoes, then you are good to go. It's such an easy way to add a little bit of flair to your outfit. Trend number four is maroon red. This deep rich color is beautiful for winter, and it pairs perfectly with neutral tones. If you have a maroon sweater, scarf, or even skirt, then pull it out and add it to your wardrobe. It is an instant statement piece, and if you don't have one, this is an easy piece to add. And finally, cable nits. Cable nits are a winter essential, and I'm sure you already own one or two. They are so easy to style and great for layering, and cable nits never go out of style, so they're an investment piece that you can wear year after year. And it's even more ways to style these pieces. You can download my style app, Alphab formulas. I'll have it linked up in my bio. There you'll be able to find all of the outfits that I created from these pieces. And comment below and let me know which of these trends you already own and which ones you want to add to your wardrobe this season."," made a living off of predicting fashion trends for a few years now so these are gonna be this winter's hottest trends and whether or not I will be partaking in them. The first one is obvious faux fur faux fur everything though for bags for coats for headpieces like it's giving apricy and I love it. Another trend that I absolutely love is fair eye omnits. These look like this they look like grandma knits kind of but I think they're so cute and again it gives that like vintage ski girl vibe. I also think sheerling and Sherpa is gonna be a huge trend not only on clothes but again on bags, headpieces, gloves, riding boots but I think they're gonna be worn with leggings, skinny jeans maybe and most popularly skirts. I won't be participating in the leggings and skinny jeans thing but I will wear them with skirts. Also I feel like moon boots are gonna come back but I don't know about that one. Wearing monochromatic white outfits is gonna be a huge thing just like white on white are wearing really light colors like light beige tan oatmeal this like Sherpa color you get the vibe and then old money quiet luxury is kind of a trend for almost a year now but I think that that will continue into the winter. People are gonna be dressing very preppy lots of v-neck sweaters, cable knits, very simple outfits that look really elevated and then of course there's gonna be a ton of little micro trends within all of that but I don't really talk about those on here. Hey that's it let me know what you guys think if my trend predictions are right or wrong um I think they're right. Love you guys bye"," are the biggest style trends that will take the fashion industry by storm in 2024. And my credentials are, I'm usually never wrong. Okay, let's start off with the color of the year. Every single year there is that one eight color. Last year it was red the year before it was green. This year it's going to be a pale, dusty blue. Oldie but a goodie at this point. The flower applique trend has been going on for so long and it's not going anywhere, ladies. Especially for spring and summer, I know florals for spring groundbreaking. But it's not just a floral pattern. It is like actual floral appliques, especially clusters of them, just like Valentino did with the skirt. The rose bikinis are also going to continue to be a trend, especially for the summer. Big ass sunglasses. We're going to be transitioning from those smaller 90s sunglasses to really big shades. These Tom Ford ones are a perfect example. Like they need to cover half of your face. Need I say less. It's already started. She is one of the biggest trendsetters. I personally love this trend. I think it is so chic and more sun protection on your face. A win is a win. Tailored looks are in and the oversized dad boyfriend trend is out. Thank God. Oversized blazers are dead and we're going to be seeing more of a cinched waist with a shoulder pad moment. This also applies with jeans. The oversized jeans are going to slowly make their way out and we're going to be seeing more of this refined and feminine look featuring straight leg jeans, fleeting on the more like classic kind of 90 style jeans. This is probably the trend that I'm most excited about because as a short girl, I was never able to make the oversized denim work for me. Okay and lastly, we have dropped waist dresses. I think this is the modern 2020 Ford take on pepilim dresses giving it a much more refined and elegant look compared to like our outfits in 2012. God, what were we thinking? I love this trend. I think it is so classy and perfect for summer. And there you have it. Those are my predictions on what's going to be in style in 2024. I promise you I am probably right. Let me know what you think is going to be in style this year down below if I didn't mention it in this video."," spring, 2024 fashion trends from a fashion style as part seven. First up we are talking long tailored shorts. These are not new to the game but there are different variations on the runway for spring 24. Options in leather that are a little more oversized with cuffed tams, more fitted silhouettes and closer to the knee. Of course denim options as well, however again a little more fitted of a silhouette. If you prefer the bagier look, you not worry because they are extremely oversized versions as well. Spring 24 promotes imperfection with an undone look. A much more wearable version of this. Typically the folded over waistbands that we've seen in the past are both sides but I really like that Fendi did only one side. They did this in a skirt version as well which is so good."," I'm prediction. I'll top on right. I just don't really think enough people are noticing this in action. I have a really strong hunch that 20 tens trends are coming back, but with a twist. Okay, let's pray to God that Pepplem tops and bobble necklace does do not come back into the fray, because those are some dark times. I was a victim myself, or Asa jeans. I was the worst. Fair with me. Okay, we all know that the no trousers trend is here. I don't know if it's here to stay, but it's here. My friend Aisha is slain, but my take is that the short whip tights trend is definitely going to come back. Very soon coming to a store near you. We're not going to see them paired with rib tights and heads, I love 20 tens. My money is on taller boobs like this. You're over the kind of starting to see wink wink nudges from forward, and the way that they're styling their catalog here. This is what I'm talking about. Next trend that we're going to see coming back is more specifically red tights. Colorful tights? We've seen those. That the red tights are just going to be paired with a dainty or shoe. These are the 20 tens, but this is going to be remastered. I think the red on red is going to be huge, just giving elf energy. It's very festive. Also obsessed with the red ankle sock with the right shoe. Tiss the season of red. She's back in full swing, folks."," as already know what time it is and if you don't, it's time to get a clue. The summer was fun while it lasted but now fall is knocking on your door. Now it's time to get into some 2023 fall fashion trends I'm obsessed with. This is a very divisive trend because you either love them or despise them. Low-right jeans have been on the rise for a minute and they're not going anywhere. This is a very early 2000s trend but instead of it being super tight like the ones we saw in Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton back in the day, we're going for a bagier style. And with the rise of the point to shoe, low-right jeans are just it. I literally just brought three pairs of low-right jeans in preparation for fall. Low-right jeans are just so much more flattering than those ultra high jeans that sit right under your boob. Disgusted. It just lights something inside of me and there's so many different ways that you can style it. Right now, low-right jeans are ruling the world. Chokers are a huge trend and it isn't slowing down anytime soon. I've worn a few myself. It's a very 90s inspired trend but I love the different iterations of it that I've seen recently. I've seen a lot of different flower chokers, whether that be fabric or some type of hard acrylic plastic material. There was one that went super viral from Zara that was all over the place. And now there's these bubble hearts that I'm obsessed with. This gold choker from Prada literally lives in my head ring-free. If I had an infinite money glitch, this would already be in my possession. Trust me. But you don't have to spend a whole bunch of money on this trend like there's some that you can get on Amazon for like eight bucks. That's where I got mine. I love it. I think it's so cute. I think it adds extra flair and pizazz to any outfit. It's such a fun trend. And it's something that you could definitely style and make your own."," 2023 summer fashion trends. The first one is the old money in quiet luxury aesthetic. This trend is all about looking elevated and classic with basic staple pieces. We are moving towards looks that are really simple but look really classic and elegant. So this summer definitely invests in good quality basic pieces. Next one is vintage bags and vintage shoes. Thrifting items is not new whatsoever, but this year this vintage shoes and vintage bags are super trendy. Everyone is going crazy for these bags and for these shoes. I love when we have sustainable fashion trends. You cannot tell me you haven't seen this Dior pointy toe heels a million times already. But at the same time, these items are limited and are unique pieces which is definitely what makes them so special. Next one are white jeans. This definitely comes from the quiet luxury trend. I've been seeing this white jeans so much. It's a great piece to look casual but at the same time quite elevated. They are definitely way more dressy than a regular pair of jeans. And for summer they are absolutely perfect. Next trend is flowers. Flowers on tops, flowers on dresses, in shoes and literally everywhere. I mean, I'm wearing a flower too. So it's quite obvious that I love this trend. It's such a great way to add a little bit of a next-to-a-detail to any outfit. And they even elevate any outfit, in my opinion."," You guys want to talk Spring 2023 fashion trends? Good, me too. Through a lot of fashion trends, we saw coming off the Spring 2023 runways, but I'm going to take you through four of them that I feel are the most wearable and translatable to street style. The first thing I really noticed is metallic and particularly in breast plates. We saw them on the runways of Gabriela Hurst and Laquan Smith. We saw a lot of sequence everywhere, particularly off Tom Ford's runway, and worn like this with a little bit more of a special asymmetrical top, but you could also translate that to everyday street style by pairing a simple pair of metallic trousers with the corset and a little black tee. These inspo photos from the runways are meant to inspire you, so don't take them so literally. Now here are some pieces I love within the metallic and sequence framework. Love this metallic, muted, boostier from end other stories. It could be worn simply like this with a pair of straight leg trousers or denim. You could even layer it over a little button down or t-shirt. This little mesh crop top screams going out in Vegas to me from Fanny Shivani. I would not wear it with the skirt. It would be so cool with like high-waisted denim or vintage 501 Levi's. Love this skirt from Neely Low-Tan. You could also buy the polo sequence matching top, but I would just do one or the other and pair it with more simple pair down basics. All these have sort of a nod to the 80s, and we saw a lot of it on Tom Ford's runway. The second thing we're going to be seeing a lot of this spring is clean, simple tailoring. Now a good suit is always a good idea, but they really dominated the runways of Jill Sander and Peter Dew. And beautiful materials and clean lines make a suit anything but boring like this. And love this here with the gold button detail. And obsessed with this clean sophisticated monochromatic suiting with the matching blouse. Here's some suiting separates I love. Love this waistcoat from Vince plus size inclusive. It could be worn simply and elegantly like this or you could layer a button down underneath. These simple hounds tooth trousers from mango currently on sale. The third thing that dominated the runways was denim. We saw a lot of super oversized denim, the bigger the better and also denim maxi skirts. Love this vibe on Kate Moss. Love this double denim look with the long denim maxi skirt. And this is a look that can be easily replicated straight off the spring runways by wearing a simple black blouse and if you're not sure about the oversized denim trend, keep everything on the top more fitted and minimal. Here's some pieces I love within the denim category. Love this denim light wash skirt from Pistola denim and love these oversized jeans from Levi's currently on sale. And obsessed with these the row jeans. And the next thing I noticed a lot of coming off the runways were super size blazers. The oversized blazer trend started many years ago and it hasn't gone anywhere but the blazers are getting bigger and better. Love how Naomi wore her super size blazer with coordinating trousers. You can wear them with denim or other trousers. And I'm always a fan of this kind of styling a long maxi dress with an oversized blazer over your shoulders. And this the row matching suiting is perfection. Here's some blazers I love. Love this one from the"," from last year that are gonna follow us into winter 2022 fashion from you'll literally never see it coming. A fashion major part two. First stop in arguably one of the best feathers like this or this. We saw this one a lot last year. It's definitely here to say especially seeing a lot of feather trim like this or this and a lot of the very wispy all-strich-like feathers like this or like this and a lot of very over-the-top dramatic feathers like this or this. I love it. Next up literally nothing new at all but still very relevant. Baggy pants. They're seeing a lot of baggy jeans like this and the baggy or loose fitting trousers like this, this or this and this year we're seeing a lot of baggy parachute pants like this, this or this. This one is such a big trend this year too. I still got more so like in comment for part three."," my favorite fall trends and how to style them. Taylor mashing suit definitely bringing the nighties back I will style them like this, this and like this. Carcobans coming all the way from summer I will style them like this and this. If you still haven't seen them vests are so entrant right now and also even strong nighties vibes I will style them like this, this, this and this. Bomberjack had been one of the biggest trends for this fall perfect for any casual look I will style them like this, this, this and like this. Follow for more."," shorts trends for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Part two. First up, we're gonna be seeing a lot of boxer shorts. I actually love them. Like actual boxers worn as shorts or just shorts that mimic the look of boxers. Like these, I think it's a great casual short. I feel like they're very similar to these types of shorts that we're seeing a lot of too. We're still seeing a lot of the cute little knit shorts like these, but we're also gonna be seeing them in much bolder colors like this. Or like this, lots of patterns too. I don't think we're ever not gonna love a good linen short for summer. Like these, and I love how this pairs a little longer. I definitely think we'll be seeing a lot like that. Also, this pairs on clearance for $14 so somebody please buy them. And with how much we're loving trousers this year, it should come as no surprise. We're gonna be seeing a lot of trouser shorts like these. I think it's great for being casual and cute, but still put together. Also like these. Like for part three."," trends for 2022. We've talked about this before, but break your ankle platforms are all the rage. We're also going to see them in fun metallics. Metallic cowboy boots are also a high love this color. Texture shoes, especially women will be everywhere. We're also going to see a lot of bejeweled heels. I think the interesting heels shapes are here to stand. A lot of designers are taking it up a knot. We're also going to see Velcro and the return of classic birks. Like for the next part."," someone who likes to dress cute, I have the best little style trick for you. So you're gonna take a black turtleneck and then you're going to grab a button down. You're then gonna tuck her in and you're gonna scrunch up the sleeves. You're gonna take the turtleneck underneath and you're gonna messily, I don't know if that's a word. Scrunch it over the shirt. Okay a little of that, a little of that and cute!"," Okay guys, here are some trends to look out for for fall 2021. First up, we have a saturated color. And we're gonna be seeing a lot of lilac, the screen color, paints and magenta, so they're gonna be huge along with burnt orange. Also keeping out for blues like this and these dark reds. For example, I'm loving this look of these red cowboy boots, which is a simple outfit, and this leads me into the next run. Cowboy boots for huge for the summer, and I was obsessed with it, and you can bet they're not going anywhere for fall 2021. Okay, next up, we're gonna be seeing tailored suit sets, specifically the three-piece suit set. The wall of my personal favorite, the crop blazer. And we're gonna be seeing specifically a lot of crop blazer and skirt sets, which is to die for. Which leads me into this trend. We saw a lot last fall, but it's gonna be coming back bigger and better this fall. It's the dark academia probably style. I know this one is very controversial, but we're gonna be seeing a lot of low rise loose fit jeans. Whether you like them or not, they're gonna be here this fall. And the last thing I've been seeing is funky printed tights. You definitely need a style that's correctly, but I'm so excited to see what people come up with this fall.", Some are fashion trends I'm loving. First off is the halter neck. It's super sexy and screams summer Next is a good matching set because it makes your life super easy You don't even have to think of what to wear Next is a one-shoulder it makes your outfit just a little more interesting and is perfect for those date nights Next trend is bubble gum pink. I have been loving this for color in the summer and it looks so good on Tan skin Lastly is the ties trend. I love this one. It's super unique and edgy and is perfect for those nights out," Three styles of shorts that are gonna be huge to this spring and summer. Number one, loungewear is not leaving anytime soon. We're gonna see a lot of sweatshorts and matching sweatsheds all summer. Try airy, pretty little thing, and misguided to shop those. You probably expected this one leather shorts. Here's a brown pair on Zara's website, but you'll be able to find these literally anywhere. Number three is mom slash dad shorts. I'm talking like borderline Bermuda shorts. Literally go to your dad's closet, go to the third store, find a pair of baggy jeans, and just cut them.",,,,
,," fashion trends for spring 2025. We're definitely going to be seeing the return of some boho chic styles, but rather than like this, it's going to come through as a lot of ruffles and sheer materials, especially as tops like this, this, or this that you can just wear jeans or other things you have in your closet. Also on the top of sheer, we're going to be seeing a lot of sheer skirts like this, or this. We'll also continue to see a lot of western influences, such as denim on denim, and cow print and I love this jacket. And that will also include fringe, and the fringe can even venture outside of the western realm to something like this, or this. And next is studs. This also comes back to the western influences, so that could be a studded belt like this, studded flats, or studded bags like this, or this. Then I'm also seeing a lot of these pastel colors, which definitely isn't new for spring, but a lot of this pistachio green like this, or like this powder pink like this, or like this, and butter yellow like this, or like this. And as always, you don't have to like or participate in fashion trends, but let me know in the comments which ones you like and which ones you don't."," What cool girls be wearing for winter? 2024, part three. Fur trimmed coats. The style elevates any outfit and gives me like old money vibes. Obsessed with the fur trim on this leather jacket, they'll have any trend of that place around with texture, so cute. Cots with built-in scarves, what a genius design. Been seeing this particular style of coat everywhere. The style looked me worn in so many different ways, but I really like this mergeriscy outfit with the brown trousers and then the pointed flats. Looks so good paired with denim and sneakers. The built-in scarf also looks really good with a cropped coat, healed loafers. Loafers went from being a trend to a colossus table over the past few years, but were mixed it up a little bit by adding a heel. It adds a bit more femininity to the style. It's so nicely with the tailored suit sets, especially the ones with the midi skirts. And if you don't like the loafers with the heel, you can also go for a chunky loafer, which will still give you some added height. Belted blazers. Not only is the belt an added accessory, but then it also makes the blazer just a little bit more flattering. I really like this outfit with the tail of the belt left out. The style also looks really good with a belt with a larger buckle obsessed with the dress blazer combo."," 24 fashion trends with the fashion styles and we're to buy the best options right now. I know I've been preaching Zipper print, but it'll be very remiss of me to not mention that there was also plenty of leopard all across fall 24 runways. Something to note is that it took very different shape. Leopard print stockings, slouchy leopard print boots, leopard print loafers but in a lighter tone, tall leopard print boots, Christian Dior had matching leopard print sets, even paired with a leopard print hat front head to toe leopard look. I love the detail of the black piping to kind of break up some of the leopard as well as the long sleeve layered underneath the short safe top. All of these things create a more elevated version of leopard than we've seen in the past. Of this almost sheer maxi skirt for dress, I'm not sure which one it is, but the fact that it's paired with the chunky motoboot, which contrasts the super feminine skirt, this styling perfection. Now which options to buy starting with this vest that is giving Gani with a price that is not. I'm obsessed with this jacket. The fact that there is contrasting stripes, pattern mixing with the leopard is just too cool and it's just different. You don't see this walking down the street every day. Something about how this is kind of like a faded leopard, which is like lived in, it's like I've owned this forever. I love that. Same with these pants. Mark Fisher has the perfect leopard kitten heel. I love this leopard bag by style. The colors in it are just so rich. This Jean Paul Goethe a top is so cool. This would pair perfectly with a darker washed black denim, paired with an oversized leather jacket, leather blazer, whether it be black or chalk brown. Perfect night out, cool top. Another option for night out is this Simon Miller partially sheer dress. We do it with a tall black boot. You could probably even do a black sock bootie, similar to the boots here. It's top by free people. If you don't want to wear too much leopard, this is the perfect accent by Isabel Moran, a brand that has perfected leopard print and that is gony. Looking for a shoe, Louis Vuitton has an entire Anomalia collection, including these ballerinas."," 2024 fashion is borderline ugly. Now I'm not talking about repeat trends, I'm talking about the unique original style that defines a year. And when it comes to 2024, seems like it's all about mismatching, more is more, multiple textures, multiple shapes, pairing completely different styles with each other. Outfits that on paper make absolutely no sense at all. Like these are literally the outfits you end up in when you clean your room too hard. Like I have worn this outfit a million times as a kid cleaning my room. Socks, heels, gym shorts. But for some reason, 2024 style is so bad and so weird that it is good. At least the Gen Z in the orange generation. It's like somehow it works. But obviously everyone has their own opinions so let us know yours in the comments below."," All alpha combinations for spring for when you don't know what to wear. Starting with my favorite, buttoned down cardigans with shorts. It doesn't exactly need to be boxer shorts, but I love how they look paired with cardigans. You can switch the boxer shorts for a cute pair of shorts like this or add it as shorts or any type of shorts that you like. For shoes, my favorite are boots with longer socks, in case you need to be a little bit warmer. And also flats. Another alpha combo that I love is the white monochromatic look. I don't know why, but I love a Y-Mexi skirt pair with a Y-Q top. You literally cannot go wrong with this. This is my lazy girl alpha combo for when I don't know what to wear. And still want to look cool. Next, we have the denim sets. This is literally perfect. Just put some pants and a jacket in the same shade of denim. And you're good to go in a super cool outfit. You can do the jacket with a skirt, pants, or shorts. And my favorite shoe is always the boot. Next, we have the mini skirts with a good leather jacket. You literally cannot go wrong with this alpha combo. I love them with boots. It's simple, it's cool. Everyone has or should have a good leather jacket and some mini skirts. The color matching up the shoe with the jacket is perfection. My favorite alpha combo."," If you want to know what the girlies are wearing this fall and winter but you don't care enough to actually do the research, I got you this is what's going on. I'm not sure how I feel about it but the Breton strips like this design with the lines, that is very big. Literally could not be me but Jean skirts but like long silk skirts. I can get behind this. This is cool. I like this. I've asked like normal girlies. This is like a lot but it does seem like doable. Speaking of a lot, this is that. This is like the new business type of look, the laser, the loafers like you're going to school but also a business meeting. We can do this one girlies. Puffer jackets fall sizes. Neutrals. We're still going with the neutrals. All neutrals. Besides red. Red is the color of winter. Don't ask me why. Don't know who made that up but it is the thing. Calling this like the timeless dresses. I call it quiet luxury. If I had this dress on I would look like this is what I think of. Something like this however I could totally do. Boho chic is a thing. I like the idea of layering and being cozy and wearing like a booty heel. That's cute. And we have plaid. Really you just want like one statement piece of plaid in your closet. They're calling it like the Persian fall and like a blazer would be good. The dad jacket. Love this. This is my one of my favorites. The dad jacket is going to be in brown for sure and make it look used. You want your dad's jacket. Any high boots you need a pair of these in your life. If this isn't your style like the bulky look get something that's fitted to your leg. Finally sweater dresses are making a comeback and matching sets. The whole thing.", 2023 Fast & Trends that you absolutely need to know about. Red is the color of the season. It can be head to toe red or major couple red accessories. We've all seen this especially on Kendall Jenner but it's time to embrace the no pants look. Number three a black tie moment. I actually really love this trend. The business women look is probably my favorite. Really embrace the suit because this look isn't going anywhere. Next is just keeping it simple with an effortlessly chic look. This trend has been around for a few seasons and it's the full leather looks which honestly is such a vibe. And finally for the last trend it's time to channel that sexy nerdy librarian. What are you most excited for?," I'm gonna keep this body suit and add my favorite Maxie skirt. Maxie's words are so big right now. I'm gonna make it a little little wasted. Keep it somewhat casual, so let's add some tennis shoes. This big pendant necklace. They're also so big this summer. And here is the finished look. I think we did really good outfit number two. I think we should do a little dressier. I'll start with this top, plain black mini skirt. Get some accessories going. You'll sandals, matching bag, very sleek black sunglasses. Here is the finished look. I love how it all ties together. Hey, last one. Gonna start with some jeans. Take white tank, plain black flip-flops. I'm gonna add this belt. They're big, big trends. I love them. Black bag, another pair of black sonies. This is so casual and easy. Get so trendy, so cool girl. Or if I switch out the bag, then we can do this. Let me know which one is your favorite.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," from last year that are gonna follow us into winter 2022 fashion from a fashion major. First up we have puffer jackets like this, this, or this. I'm not gonna lie I didn't think we'd be seeing this one again with how popular they've been the past couple years but I was wrong and I'm very glad I was. I'm still seeing them a lot. Next up everyone's favorite or least favorite? Agh boots. Specifically the mini-eggs. Still seeing them a lot. The kook game de zei alo. Lana approved a bugs. See your words especially seeing them in the ugg slippers and of course the platform hugs. If fellow wears them we have no option. Like for part two.", 2022 fashion trends from you will literally never guess a fashion major part three first up you're either gonna love it or hate it like warmers while these are so cute and kind of giving that ski resort glam I think a lot of what we're gonna be seeing is more casual wearable version like this or this I saw this tiktok her makes them out of an old pair of jeans how for can cute next up is one of my favorites 90s minimalism I think lots of straight angles t-shirts long skirts I think it's so cute and I think it could really be worked into the preppy style for this fall can be very elegant but also sporty and vintage I love it except we have mid calf boots like these these or these and we're gonna be seeing a lot of pin stripes like this or this a lot of the newspaper print too chef's and of course low-rights jeans I'm sorry like for part four," If you want to be that girl this summer here are four easy fashion trends to jump on. First, these linen and wide leg jogger pants are super trending right now. They're also really comfortable and lightweight for the warm weather ahead. Next is the adorable clock clips. I have literally seen them all over social media. These floral ones are super popular and you might have also seen these, which I'm actually wearing right now. They have over 20,000 reviews. Next are reusable bags like this cute canvas one. We love that they're great for the environment as well. I've also seen a lot of people carrying these mesh reusable grocery bags as a full purse which is super fun and bright colored for summer. Last are these oversized button downs which are great just layering piece to throw on over a summer look. There's a ton of color options to choose from and I'll share a few of my favorites."," Spring and Summer 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major part three. Another unexpected and kind of controversial one, clogs. We're especially seeing these Birkenstock clogs. Cannot lie at first I was not about it but I think this is cute. These two. We've been so used to small bags and shoulder bags but we're starting to see much larger bags. And bigger back packs, bigger tote bags, which lucky for us is great for practicality. We're also seeing a lot of really chunky heavy knitwear or heavy crochet, like just imagine all of the color combos for Spring and Summer. We're also seeing a lot of body chains or body jewelry, especially worn on top of clothing. This one's a little extra but I think it's so beautiful. It's giving this and and lots of keyhole cutouts like this or this like for part four."," In the street where trends we've seen so far in 2021, wide denim and cargo, skinny jean wave is officially over and a straight slash wide jean is now in control. The wide jean wave has also had a massive effect on the cargo pant trend. People have moved to straight cargo's as opposed to tightly cuffed ones. If you want to stay ahead of the cargo trend, buy a pair of cargo's that allows you to adjust to be tightness of the opening of the leg. Another trend we've seen continue to smash it in full winter 2021 is premium and oversized hoodies. Brands such as Represents, Pangaea, Yeezy and Gap, they've all smashed it so far this season, filled it throughout all of 2021. The buying habits surrounding hoodies have changed. People have spent hundreds on these random playing hoodies just for the quality and the comfortability. Here's a question for you. So what trends have you seen pop up in winter 2021 so far?"," Okay guys, these are gonna be Fall 2021 trends Part 3. First up, I've said it before and I'll say it again, Kelly Green is the absolute eight color. Like, she's stunning. This one I'm so excited about but loafers are huge, especially chunky ones. Look at how beautiful I want these so bad. Next up, we've already been seeing a lot of these, the cropped puffer fest are huge. I just ordered a brown one like this. I think they're so cute. We're just loving cropped out of where this fall, cropped blazers are huge and a matching set like this, or on its own either way. This one we've seen a lot already in Fashion Week and I'm so here for it but the gloves. I think they're gonna be a really popular casual accessory this fall, like imagine how decadent you'd feel wearing these. We've also already been seeing a lot of the tailored fest and I'm so here for it. This one's nothing new but it's gonna be extra huge this year and that's super super chunky knitwear. Another accessory that'll have the inner blare walled ortho and all of us thriving and that it is headbands. Last but not least utilitarian cargo style pants."," Look at this, this, this, this. That's, I never knew I love this so much. Here am I going, I feel so good. That's what I'm gonna be like. Yeah, I feel really good. What shoes? Yes, a little, a little twist-align. I don't know what this set is called. Wait a little accident. We threw it out, threw it out in the trash. But let's see. So this is the brush shot in Matt Pearl. And then the pants are Armstrong in Matt Pearl. Go get it."," These spring fashion words you need to know. Color, block. This is coming from Laptop. Cowl. This is a cowl neckline and it's a cute ass tank, isn't it? Mock neck. Pretty much like a baby turtle neck.",,,,
,," 2025 trend predictions. The boho style is gonna have a huge comeback this 2025. We are gonna see a ton of flower dresses, romantic blouses like this one, a lot of lace and flowy fabrics, also a mix of a hippie style with the boho, maxi skirts and tops like this are gonna be everywhere, as well as linen or cotton matching sets like this one. Another huge aesthetic is gonna be the Noriko aesthetic. We are gonna see a lot of stripes, the both shoes, which honestly are kinda growing on me. A lot of striped polos like this one, also striped shirts, rough your hats and rough your bags and caps, a lot of white and also scarves. Next is the cowboy era and we have Belachadid to thank for this. We are of course gonna see a lot of western boots, a lot of denim, cowboy hats, stud belts, and even cable nids or nids like this or jewelry that resembles or has a western aesthetic vibe, as well as worker jackets like this one. I see a lot of people talk about the comeback of skinny jeans, but I have to disagree, I think that we are gonna see more of this 90s or 80s straight leg jeans. These jeans are way more versatile, they are definitely timeless and in my opinion way more flattering than skinny jeans. I feel like you get the best of both worlds, but definitely we are moving away from the really white leg jeans. I briefly mentioned this but a statement belt. Elts are gonna be the most important accessory for this 2025, a belt can make or break an outfit. I personally love belts, it is such an easy way to elevate an outfit, to bring back some dimension to add an extra detail, so this year definitely invests in a couple of belts."," part two of winter 2024 fashion trends. Now that we're a little bit into fall, I have a better idea of what trends are going to be following us into the new year. First one being styling baseball caps. This outfit right here has to be one of my favorite ways to style baseball caps other than a leisure. Your favorite vintage leather jacket, a pair of straight-like jeans, and a crisp white tee. Perfect. The way Elsa paired the pop of color with her shoes and her hat is just, I wouldn't expect anything less from her. And similar to the last picture, I think styling a baseball cap with like a pea coat like this is such a cute look and a little vintage bag. Next is statement earrings. These in particular are amazing. Also like these, we've all seen this style. And to create an in-earscape like this and also mixing silver and gold is so fun. Next is pen stripes. Dressing them down with a graphic tee like this, or you can do a full-on business woman special like this. You know we've been seeing blazers and slacks for a minute and this is kind of a fun variation. Off the shoulder, in dresses like this, or a top like this, we've also been seeing sweaters that are off the shoulder a lot. I think it's kind of a fun way to make like a sweater sexy. Follow up for the next part."," This past fashion month, designer said no florals were spring. Instead, we're seeing one big color trend that revolves around deeper shades of red. Burgundy, oxblood, whatever you want to call it, it's already taking up tons of space on the market. If you want to get ahead of the curve and start wearing it this winter, you can rely on the moodiness of deep darker reds to carry well into spring."," Summer 2024 trends that are worth your money. I've been talking Pinterest and the summer runway looks so you don't have to. And I know there's a lot of trends out there, but I handpicked the ones that are worth investing in. So the first trend is everything sheer. Jere was all over the runways, and it's a great way to play with textures, add interest to an outfit, plus it's sexy. You can add it through a skirt, address, or a top like this, or a mesh ballerina. I've been loving this lace skirt and shirt look. Moving on, we have denim on denim. A lot of designers feature denim looks like Carolina Herrera and even Dior, and I know what you're thinking, but it can look so polished. I love a denim button down with shorts. You can also do a denim dress, and this look is my favorite. The third trend is butter, yellow, blue, and red are going to be the colors of the summer. I love that we have so many good color options. A great way to add interest to your outfits is through adding pops of these colors. The next trend we're going to see a lot is the preppy chic style. This style dominated on the runways, and thanks to Zendaya's Challengers Tennis Movie, it's going to be big. It's just perfect for summer. Think polo shirts, pleated skirts, stripes everywhere, and even headbands. Finally, we have elevated basics. This year, ladies, we're going to level up our basics game by adding a twist. So we're gonna have waistcoat's fests, asymmetrical tops, of the shoulder blouses, cinched waistblazers, and drop waist dresses. What do we think about these trends? Which ones are your favorite?"," You want to stay on trend for spring 2024. This is what's going to be in and out, just coming from somebody trying to stay in style. I don't know how I feel about this one, but small bags were the only things in. But now we're going to be seeing the bigger bag. You weren't the it girl, unless you had a skim stress. And instead of being super skinned, tight, removing into a more feminine, roughly girly girl area. Dating to get jewelry, you guys is on its way out. Now the maximalist, more bolder jewelry, is in. We saw so many oversized scrunchies. Instead, the hair bows are in. Everybody remembers when sparkle was everywhere, especially when Haley Bieber wore her sparkle boots. Now as the rise of the studs, we're going to be seeing studs and flats, heels, boots, everywhere, who was a mob wife girly? Because instead of removing into a Cal Girl area, Hamo is out. Because we're seeing the Cheetah Prince, a zebra prince, a stripes, all the prince. But it was my biggest inspiration for the oversized sunglasses, especially the ones from Amazon took the world by storm. But now we're seeing some slimmer sunglasses and more retro style. It's front-be-free people jumpsuit used to be in. Instead, we're seeing the rise of the jeans, jumpsuit, and a more fitted approach. Clock clips are going to be here to stay, but instead of the flower, we're going to be seeing more basic clock clips. I'm not saying the sandals with the mini dresses are out, but if you really want to be fashion, we're seeing the rise of the knee-high boots and dresses. And especially try it with a cowboy boot. Have you tried the square toe heels? Don't worry about it, because they're not it anymore. Because point toe is still here to stay. And I hope you didn't buy any expensive cargo pants. It is time for the rise of the Capri's and trousers are still going to be in. It's going to be part two. Part one is going to be linked to my caption. What are you going to miss? What do you not agree with? Let me know."," The winter is right around the corner, so we're gonna talk about the biggest trends that you could expect to see this coming winter. I'm not kidding, every time I open up my Instagram, the totem jacket is everywhere. This Sheerling toggle jacket is going to be the face of this winter. It's also like $3,000, so I found a lot of doops for you guys. This one's by far my favorite, it's from source unknown, it's $488, but it's on sale until November 28th, 50% off. It comes in white also. I haven't bought anything from Abercrombie and like, I don't know, years, but I saw the day out of doop and I just bought this like two days ago, $112. This one's from Free People. Mango also has one. This cream color is gonna be the main color that we're seeing of these jackets. We'll see them with her doll necks. Also seen in Vests, I love the way the Daniel Burns seem more here. As you can see, she has a turtle neck under it as well. The next trend will be seeing a lot or just Sheerling jackets in general. I like them because it's a very versatile jacket. You can wear it at night, you can wear it during the day. Depending on how you want to make it look, it could be super looks. I love the way that Matilda Jurf were here. We're gonna see these in every color. I just love this brown one. And look at the way that Hannah Schoenberg did it. And look at the matching uggs, they're so soft. She just looks so cozy, like she just wants to be in front of a fireplace. Also look at that matching Sheerling bag, which we'll get into in another video, so stay tuned for part two. But just note that a lot of the Sheerling that we're seeing has this elastic thing in the back. Like what would you call that thing? Stretchiness? Whatever the point is, Sheerling is everything. Get your hands on anything Sheerling. Also I'm wearing a Sheerling jacket as I make this and it's beautiful and it's from Chewsy. But yeah, fall for part two. Okay, bye."," 5 of fall 2023 runway trends. I'm gonna go through some common trends that we saw across multiple runway shows and I've been so scared to share these trends with you guys and I've delayed this video for like weeks. I know you're gonna have a lot to say about this so I'm just gonna rip the bandaid off starting with Chevron pattern. So if you've been following along you know that early to mid-2000s are here and it's terrifying for a lot of us. All I will say is proceed with caution. This is Miss Sony fall 2023 runway shows. They're showing Chevron in a vertical way and we've normally seen it horizontal. So they're putting their own take on it. That's really cool. I like the way that they did this. Like I honestly don't hate it and that's what is scaring me so bad. A lot of what we're seeing though is like the zoomed in Chevron pattern. This is Stella McCartney fall 2023 and this looks like the literal Chevron gas station sign with just the one dip perfectly acceptable. That's okay. Love that. This is also Balmon with their own take on the Chevron pattern. You can see there's some little like gallops in it but I find it the day that is a Chevron pattern and it's coming back. Next up is Polkadot patterns and this is very much in alignment with the 80s themes that we've been seeing. Polkadot's been popping up across a lot of runway shows. However, we're doing it in a very elevated way. So we're seeing this as actual applique is on to the garment itself. This gives it a 3D effect dimension and texture and I don't typically go for a Polkadot myself but I'm honestly really here for this. Here we're seeing this gorgeous jacket by Marney and again it's not a super typical Polkadot. These are actually little flowers just placed on the garment as if it were a Polkadot pattern. I love this. From Versace's pre-fall 2023 collection we have Polkadots. They have Polkadots all over this runway but then they also inserted butterflies as Polkadots. Love that. Do a leap of collaborated on this collection and you can tell that's definitely her touch and I'm so here for it. Next up we're moving over to accessories just a bit because I want to talk about scarves and I know that you guys are going to come at me and say that scarves have been around forever and you're absolutely right but they do go in and out of style and we are currently seeing massive draped scarves almost as sometimes a poncho. We're seeing this align with the capes that we've been seeing. Here we have Saint Laurent pre-fall 2023. This big scarf draping off the back of her. Gorgeous. Marney also had scarves all over their pre-fall 2023 collection and again we're aligning with that oversized look and the way that this is so long it is literally on the floor. We also have Alexander Wang with the faux fur scarf like this draped in the front falling in the back. Obsessed this is the most elevated way that you could possibly wear a scarf. Of course I ran out of time so come back for more because we need to talk about clutches that aren't actually clutches and capes. Bye.", Summer 2023 fashion trends part two. Let's get into it. We all know the same business in the front party in the back. This summer is all about open backs. Sheer styles are also here to stay. Tony Bianco kitten heels are just chef's kiss. Butter yellow is the color of the summer. Otega has been the clear trend setter for statement earrings this season or you can court take in the eight dollar Amazon doops.

Like for the next part."," Jacket and Outerwear trends for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Part two. First up, I feel like this one doesn't even need to be explained, but a good blazer. We're especially seeing a lot of cropped blazers. I love this one might not really come to mind when you think of Outerwear, but a good button up shirt. Used as a jacket, of course. I honestly think this one's my favorite for spring and summer. It's super lightweight, super breathable, and I love in Texas, so we can have actual jackets. So I feel like this is just the perfect alternative. We're also seeing a lot of jackets like this. This exact one is from Girf Avenue, honestly, all of their pieces, especially Outerwear right now, or just... I'm seeing a lot of the zip up knit jackets like this. I think it's great for spring and summer, and they're just so cute. Like this. I also think it's a great way to add some color, especially pastels. It's giving very scandy, a Copenhagen vibes. I love it. I like for Part 3."," Spring trends, worth of now everyone wants to hate a wedge right now, but I am obsessed with the PVC ones. I love these. I also think hearts will be everywhere. It's something very Y2K that I can get on board with. We've talked about fun-shaped heels before. Now we're gonna see fun-shaped bags. This isn't the most practical, but I am obsessed. Front ties and side ties are gonna be huge. We're also gonna see bleached brows. I weirdly love this. Colorful leather isn't going anywhere. And we're gonna see more fun eyeliner. Like for the next part.", Fashion trend cycles predict that every 20 to 30 years a fashion trend recycles. So you know what that means. Uggs. Don't say I didn't warn you.," Okay guys, transfer last year that are gonna follow us into fall 2021 part 2. First up, we have the shoulder bag. We've been all over it lately and thankfully it's not going anywhere. I already mentioned the oversized sweater vest, but Miss Water vest just deserves another moment. I think we'll also be seeing them cropped in lots of colors that literally can be done so many ways. Last year we saw the Letterman jacket emerge. I think we're gonna be seeing it a lot in casual outfits. Especially vintage looking ones I'm obsessed. Croc Leather is nothing new. We've been seeing it a lot in shoes and handbags, but I think we're gonna see it more in clothing this year. The Shacket. The Shacket was the clothing item last year and don't worry, it's not going anywhere. This year we're gonna keep seeing it in a lot more colors and patterns. There's literally no limit. Tennis skirts are having their absolute moment and with preppy being huge this fall they are here to stay. And we're gonna be seeing them done a lot in all of our favorite fall plads. Next up, the trousers we love her. We're gonna be seeing them in all of the fall colors and fabrics and of course in plaid. Last but not least, the oversized button up you need one this...", four trends for this summer that you'll actually want to wear according to a fashion critic. Waste and mid-reflossing is in. This 2000s trend that accentuates the waste has seen a comeback for 2021. And Bra let's are also in again. They have been for the last couple of seasons and they're back for this summer. Wet with shorts for a casual look with high-waisted trousers of something more dressed up or over shirt for a dress for something less revealing. Cut out silhouettes were big during autumn winter 20 and are going to be big in trend this summer. This trend is a nice way to show some skin without going for the classic cleavage or leggy look. And the classic monochrome palette has made a comeback. Monochrome pieces are timeless and easy to style which makes them a great trend that will be able to fit into any wardrobe.," Spring trends that you should and should not buy first up. We have the patchwork exposed hem trends It's so overdone. I think it looks kind of cheap and it will definitely be at the bottom of your closet in like a week It's the 2021 version of this top Instead, I would definitely invest in a mesh button down top These are so versatile and we've worn in so many different ways You can put a tank top underneath and wear it to work You can put it over a bikini as a cover up You can wear it like how she's wearing it here. You should not buy the high-biscus print trend This is another super dated pattern that is going to go away like this Instead, I would just opt for a classic floral print. You see these kind of dresses come back every single year I don't know about you, but I don't have the budget to buy a whole new spring wardrobe every year So I'm gonna need a floral dress that will last the next year and the year after that Finally, you should not buy these white-to-him mini skirts. I feel this looks like something I wore in middle school Instead, you should buy a satin-mitty skirt. They're chic and classic and can be styled in so many different ways",,,,
,," I'm a personal stylist and I want to take you through my favorite trends for spring 2025 and how I would style each of them in a realistic way. This first trend is the track pant and I think because we're so used to styling these, go into the gym or in a much more athlete's your way, it's important to style them with pieces that are far less casual in order to make this look very intentional and to channel that juxtaposition. Stiling these with a blazer is the perfect example. I love the workwear, workout clothes, cross open, and the loafers and ballet flats. I also think it'd be really cool to do these with a pair of kidnails. This sequin shell texture I can't get enough of, I always say that one of the easiest outfit formulas for a night out is a sequin mini skirt, a white t-shirt, and a pair of heels. These cascading boho ruffles are going to be huge for spring this year. Of course you can do this in a blouse style with a pair of jeans but I also think it's going to be really cool to switch it up with a longer ruffled dress over top of a pair jeans. So you could do a ruffled two piece set and style it with a thick belt and a pair of suede knee-high boots just to lean into that boho feel if that's your vibe or to take advantage of the spring transition period which in my opinion is the best time of the year to take advantage of being able to wear mini dresses and suede knee-high boots. And another outfit that I love style with a pair of knee-high boots is a two piece denim set. I'm really into these fitted denim tops with the buttons down the front or even a denim barn jacket with a denim mini skirt of course anything polka dot is so fun on its own with this spring I'm determined to find a cute polka dot top that I can style with a pair of black capri pants and a kid in heel. I'm still so obsessed with butter yellow. I just think yellow is one of the happiest colors to ever exist so anytime that I get to put it on I'm immediately in a better mood. I really want to find a very soft butter yellow cardigan that I can style with a pair of blue and white striped box or shorts. I just think there's something about that yellow blue color combination that is just perfect for spring summer. It's been my favorite color since I was a kid so I will definitely be going all in on this but I think one of my favorite ways to style this color for spring is going to be with a burgundy red. And I want to lean into this pistachio color with some browns and tams. If you're looking for more styling, shopping, inspiration, head over to my sub-stock style baratel. I did a full debrief on all of my favorite spring style trends."," This is Tuck 2024 with tissue trends and how to style them. First up, everybody needs a pair of knee high boots. Probably my favorite way to style them is with tights and a skirt or shorts. You absolutely can't go wrong with a pair of black knee high boots. I love these ones from Workfisher. If you want to be extra on trend this year, you could also go with a pair of suede boots like these ones from Vince Commuto. Next trend on the list, we have Mary Jane Flatt. I actually really like this idea of wearing tights underneath for some extra warmth during the winter. I love this type of a shoe paired with a satin pant or skirt and an oversized sweater. It just feels very cozy and chic. Third on the list, we have mini-Ug's. I really like these outfits styled with jeans and an oversized coat for a more dressy look, but for something that's more on the casual side. I love them with a matching workoutset with a wool coat thrown over the top. And you can get all of these shoes at DSW."," trends that we will see huge for this winter. Started last year and is not going anywhere, we'll have a heat of burgundy like this is for this which I absolutely love the coordination with gold jolories, with cooler tones of it's like gray or navy. I very surprised to see them back have structured maxi skirts like this is for this which I personally found them very classic chic and perfect when it comes to highlight your silhouettes instead of gold jolory we will see a lot of silver which considering that in winter the tones are very cooler it's perfect for the season to add that light to your image. I'm now entirely sure how I feel about this trend but we will have hoodies under everything maxi coats and you can recreate either the chic look or sporty anglam. I personally think I'm gonna drop it and instead carry on on having my cute cardie on top of my call that classy look. Give her a listening and let me know what you think in the comments."," Spring, 2024 fashion trends from a fashion stylist, part two. Florals for spring, we got it. 2024 though specifically roses.

Parade them with a stylish tonal neck for that elegant, yet comfortable look. Honestly, any long coat will have you looking aesthetically pleasing.

They highlighted lots of leather, Biker jackets, of course, gloves. I can see specifically leather gloves and multi-pocketed skirts. I pretty much think cargo skirts, but I think you can also be done in leather. Number 10, micro skirts. Honestly, this should come as no surprise. We've seen her, we know her, we love her. And I think this one really ties into the Y2K trend as well. Number 11, the new waistline, which is honestly a lot more simple than it sounds like. You really just tie a hoodie, sweatshirt, whatever around your waist to accentuate it. It's cute. Okay, I'm out of time. I like for part 4."," 2022 fashion trends from you will literally never guess a fashion major Part 7 first up we have dark wash denim and I know what you're thinking denim never goes out to row over the past few years a lighter wash denim has definitely seemed to be more popular But now we're going dark. I've definitely seen a rise in popularity and dark dark denim washes lately Definitely in jeans, but also just any denim Definitely think we're gonna be all about the dark wash come fall and winter and this means a lot coming from me I used to hate dark wash denim. I don't know why but I was like if you're gonna do dark Just wear black denim anyways, but I do love it now and of course this does not mean stop wearing light washes I'm not next up is nothing new, but still hot cutouts Indresses like this this for this or in tops I'm especially seeing a lot of the keyhole cutout basically We're still seeing cutouts in just about everything.

This runway show lives right here in my head. Notice this one. So we can't forget the iconic jewelry and bags that have been around for a while. But I think fruit patterns we're gonna get more and more mainstream. I think it's also really gonna hit in the influencer space. We're gonna see more and more of these types of photos."," 2021 was a year with giant ass pants and tiny ass crop tops. Where everyone dressed like an acid troop from a children's TV show. A time when people wore bags that looked like taxidermy to animals and wore prints that looked like your great grandmother's shower curtains. Heavy emphasis on the grandma fashions. I mean, seriously, people were dressing like they were on an Ivy League tennis team. It's into our giant clothes from the dumpster. I'm so glad we've made progress."," Alright guys, here are the trends from last year that you're going to want to re-wear for Fall 2021. Number one is the oversized leather blazer.

And then also going along with that little cardigans. We'll also see this play out when they're paired together in a little matching set. Next for short the season I see the big trend being the 90s mom's style jeans that are a little bit longer. A good way to style them is with a bustier top or a little bra crop top. Or if you want to go a little more casual graphic tees also look amazing with them. These are totally the vibes I'm getting with that. Next, colored body contesure dresses, kind of like the Polaroth Lauren vibes. All around preppy. This is going to be big this season. Also monochromatic looks are going to be big as well, particularly in the green colors. Blue, orange, yellow. The colors I stated in my last video. And lastly tight biker short rompers. They're really good for layering and super cute. There's so much more to cover so like for part two."," These are my spring trend predictions.

,," spring trends around. So let's talk about some spring 2020 fashion trends that you can get off of it. So you can recreate all the cute outfits and have all the trends in your wardrobe to spring and summer. Let's go into it. We're seeing a huge trend of crochet with spring and summer trends this season. So I love this combination. I think it's so cute and so wearable. I'll make a whole video on shoe spring trends, but we're seeing a lot of shoes like this. Of course the gazelles specifically with pops of yellow and burgundy. So I love the combination of the two. We're seeing a huge rise of ethereal and we'll be seeing a lot of pinks like this. Of course we'll also be seeing blues this spring and summer. So I love this. I think it's so cute for spring shoe trends. We're taking what we've already seen and shifting to slimmer shoe styles. Very yellow is one of the biggest trend in colors that we'll be seeing for spring 2025. We're seeing a huge influx of ballet course. So I love the stress. There's so much to it. Truly looks so stunning on the weather. It's a little heel or you want to go full ballet core with the ballet flat. I think that this is actually so so beautiful. It's also giving cottage core. You'll of course be seeing lots of sudden ballet flat. This will be one of the itch's shoes as well as swed kitten heels. Little bow detailing. It's a lot of hardware. You got this color is perfect because it's a neutral but it's not too brown. It's not too pink. Oh, she is taking over and I absolutely love this skirt. I think it's perfect with cowboy boots. It also comes in white and this is a perfect spring staple skirt. And this belt over would be so cute with a brown one. I'm seeing a huge influx of belt in general this spring 2025. Especially with the boho sheet trend and I love this one because it's a little more neutral. It's still very much a statement belt but it takes up so much real estate that I think that this is such a great belt to have. Truly go over anything and change any outfit. Even just a satin maxi skirt. Of course a white cowboy boot is going to be absolutely necessary. The spring and summer shoe trend that was stick. I had this exact pair and I love them. Also, we've seen a lot of belts like this so I suggest having one in silver and in gold. Very affordable and can dress up any outfit. You have a whole new outfit the moment you put this on and it's such an affordable way to do that. And I love that we're taking the style that we really favor to the last year and we're taking it into a little set. That's a mini skirt version. That gives so cute and the different colors are fantastic. I leasing lots of sets like this and asymmetrical details for spring trends will be absolutely everywhere as well as sheer and ruffles. So I love this skirt. It's a fun way to elevate a basic piece. Shoes are part of the fishermen aesthetic as well as the boho. It's the perfect combination of the two. So I love this as a staple shoe even though it's trending. It's going to be a staple. But on that same note, it will be seen lots of asymmetrical details at top. It also comes in the sweater yellow, joe beautiful for spring and summer fashion trends."," to talk about galley and feminine outfits for winter 24. I work full-time in fashion trend forecasting. I know that lots of the trends are quite masculine at the moment. Here are some trends that are not. Can't go wrong with a fitted suit trouser. It's probably the most flattering and the most chic trouser. We're seeing lots of cinched waist silhouettes, especially with outerwear and without round shoulder. We look for outerwear pieces that have this really feminine silhouette. Jules rey is a really important part of our look this season, so we'll be wearing it over and outside of our clothes. Especially our leather gloves, but we're going to be wearing it outside of our knitwear too. A very maxima-less way. You can't pretend tatering isn't going to be a really important part of this season's fashion, but adding jewelry details like this makes it very personal and chic and very feminine. The old Mary Jane's are a key item for your shoe collection. I think pencil scarts are really elegant and feminine. These are key for this season, especially when styled with a belt like this and are pointed boots. This season for the first time ever, there were more scarts when the autumn winter runway than there were trousers. We're looking for these maxi pleated woolen scarts, and styling them with this layered effect top importantly about. Let me know if you like these outfit and styling ideas. Leave me a comment if you'd like a part two."," 2024 holiday trends and wouldn't be the holidays without fur, but I think we're gonna see fur paired with sheer skirts. We're just going to see a lot of sheer in general. Cocktail jewelry is all the way back. I am such a fan. I think silver bags will be huge. Basically any bags that are reminiscent of candy, we will also see bows and belts on bags. Obviously we will see bows in here. I also think we'll see more unique hair pieces like this and this. This is so fabulous. Velvet is always in this time of year. And I think we're going to see a lot of velvet in these peachy tones like this and this. Like for the next part."," spring, 2024, it curl items that you need in your closet. I live in New York, I go to fashion school, I work in fashion, and these are all pieces that I've literally seen, at least like three people wearing in the last couple of weeks, and I know they're gonna be huge this spring. You've been following the mob life trend, you know that leopard print is a neutral this season. So these specific pants from Ghani, I have legitimately seen like three different girls wearing them, do not wear it in an outfit like this, I don't know why they styled it like that. I've seen it with like a really oversized leather black jacket, I've seen it with like a denim jacket on top, just like a simple black or white top, but like not really this vibe. Like something edgy and cool, slick back bun, big chunky earrings, like you know the vibes. This pair from Ghani is like over $200 and super expensive, but I have no doubt there will be so many dupes and knockoffs coming out soon. So let's just call it leopard print pants this spring. On its Yuka Tigers are everywhere. If you don't know, you need to know. These are like the it sneaker in New York right now. I see these on a daily basis. Especially metallic, metallic sneakers, shoes in general are so in right now. This specific pair I found on eBay, because they're like kind of hard to find. You can get them on like stock acts or goat, but these are so cute, definitely here to stay. Okay, sheer button down tops with the collar. This has been all over New York. I think that in this summer too. Instead of doing like a blazer look because it's gonna be so hot out, it's gonna be like a sheer blouse type of look. And I think this is so cute. This example specifically is from Aritzia. When I tell you that I went like three straight days seeing someone wearing this skirt every day in a row, I'm pretty sure it's this skirt. It was like an asymmetrical lacy, roughly skirt. So I found this one. It's from free people. This site is revolved, but you can get it on free people or revolve. Don't wear it like this. Wear it with a pair of tall leather boots. Again, like an oversized jacket on top or like a fitted t-shirt. This is so cute. Lace is definitely back this spring. Okay, so if you're seeing everywhere that like super short shorts are in and you're kind of freaking out about it, don't freak out about it. Because what those of us are gonna do who are not bella-hadi or Kendall Jenner are tailored shorts. This is from and other stories, but also like Abercrombie has so many good ones. I think H&M had some really good ones. If you wanna do a short short, but like you don't want your booty cheeks hanging out, you don't wanna be like chafing with the denim. Like no, don't do that. We're doing some loose but tailored shorts. Also back to the whole metallic trend right now. Mango has these metallic shorts that I think are so cute because you could totally dress these up or dress these down with that elastic waistband. Like possibilities are pretty much endless for what you could do with these shorts. I'm obsessed. Okay, and then back to the sneakers really quick because the Adidas Samba's Adidas Gazelle shoes have been everywhere, but we're now seeing this with a pop of color. Everyone that I've been seeing wearing these are either wearing them in red, green, or maybe like an orange, black and white. We're just like over it. I mean, if that's your deal, that's totally fine. But like if you're still wearing the Nike Air Force ones, just don't, just you know, like spice it up a little bit, maybe get a little personality in there. So these I think are so cute. DSW also has this cheaper version. It's like technically a different style of Adidas, but they look the exact same to me, and I think they are so cute."," spring 2024 trends that are worth your money. I've been sucking Pinterest and the spring summer runway looks they don't have to and I know there's a lot of trends out there but I handpicked the ones that are worth investing in. The first trend is different shades of blue which was all over the runways. I love blue because it's so sophisticated and incorporating blue is easy. You can add it through a blouse or a knit, you can do blue monochrome or you can add a pop of blue through your shoes. Moving on we have metallics. A lot of the designers featured them like Balmah and Mu Mu. Metallics can sort of act like a neutral and add a touch of luxury. You can incorporate them through your outfit, shoes or accessory. The third trend which I've been seeing a lot lately is the polo shirt because of the property style dominating on the runways this year and I'm here for this trend because it's casual but chic and you can go long sleeve or short. The next trend is all about the white dress and I love this trend because I think a white dress is a staple. You can do a white dress that suits your style like short, long or flowy white dress. Finally we have roses. I'm seeing them everywhere and I know that's not groundbreaking because it's spring but we're going to see the trend in rose prints, rose details and embellishments. There are a number of ways you can incorporate roses through tops, dresses, accessories or even shoes. What do we think about these struns? Which one is your favorite?"," to look chic for work. Let's start with those flat pants. There's a thing if I look good I feel good. That's why I always try to style myself for work. But I also like wearing something comfy, wearing this great laser. Also adding a belt because I love to look more. Even though they have a heel they are so comfy. Don't know but I just can't leave the house without earrings. Also have to pack my makeup and that's the final look. And I'm ready for a productive day."," first time in a long time fall shoe trends have been vastly different than what we previously seen. I'm going to go through a guide of different shoes that are trending this fall that you can add to your closet with some various price points. I'm a fashion design student at Parsons and here are shoes that I personally want in my closet. The first trend is the Motoboo. We are seeing these all over. This is an example from Steve Madden. They're all kind of expensive. So if you're a little iffy about this trend, like maybe wait it out and see where it goes. But if someone wants to buy me these boots, thank you. I would love that. These boots are on Zara. They are slightly cheaper coming in at 139 and the leather is smoother. Whereas the Steve Madden ones, it's a little bit of a distrust leather. But basically the exact same shoe and so cute. I wanted to find a cheaper do-free also. Here is a version from Fashion Nova. I am a little bit iffy about Fashion Nova's shoes. So I would not expect that these are going to be high quality at all. But they're only $35. So again, if you're iffy, like maybe go for these and if you wear them all the time and they get really gross, then invest in a nicer pair. But these are really cute. One thing you do just want to make sure with this trend is that it's a wide calf. So as long as these boots aren't tight to your calf, you'll be totally good. Then we have the OG Harley Davidson. This is like maybe my least favorite of the boots just because I want more. But if you want a little less in terms of buckles, this is on sale at DSW right now. Again, still expensive but Harley Davidson, we know is going to be high quality. And this is honestly the boot that started at all. Next up are Mary James. Now Mary James we're seeing this season be combined with that Moto trend that we were just talking about. So those big buckles up there are really in and there's a couple different ways you can do this. But these are from Urban Outfitters. They're only $49 and like this is a big sleigh. I would absolutely wear these. Okay now these are the shoes of this fall. These are from Ghani. They are very expensive but just wait for it. Are you kidding me? We know that red is the color of fall and if you can incorporate red into any of these shoes A plus plus plus amazing beautiful. We love it. These are $395. If anyone wants to buy me these shoes, be my guest. Please do. I'm right here. Last one because silver is also so in right now in a big way. This is on Sam Edelman and I think these are so cute. This metallic silver and you can tell with the material. It's not going to get like scuffed up. It's not a pattern leather. It's kind of that a little bit more matte material. So these would be so cute this fall. Last but not least, everyone's least favorite shoe trying to have ever seen from all your comments. Ballet flats. Now Urban Outfitters has this version right now. It's only $39. That's a great deal in this really cool like holographic black color. Again, that big buckle really like giving the moto trend that we've been seeing. I think that these are so cute. I would absolutely rock these and this is definitely a good transition for a Mary Jane to more of a ballet flat. Another silver option for the ballet flat like this with a pair of light wash baggy jeans. A white t-shirt. Are you kidding? Give it a pair of like red sunglasses or something for a pop of color. Maybe even just red nails like that's a whole last fit. Also gap. You're going crazy. I've never bought shoes from gap before but like I might have to. Okay, and then this is more classic ballet flat. This is also on Sam Edelman. There are like 9,000 colors there right now. So I actually think these are really cute and I know everyone hates that ballet flats are back but they're just really in right now. They're not going to go away for a while and I think it could be done really well if you style it right. Okay, that's all for now but there's honestly so much more so come back soon and I'll give you all the recs you need for this fall. Love you, bye!"," Fashion trends will be seeing in Australian summer 2023 2024. Now with your opinion summer over and fashion week done and dusted, we're now starting to see Australian designers come out with their campaigns and just these trends cemented in fashion. So they're not necessarily predictions because they're sort of already in play. The first one is the Bermuda short. It's sticking around. We sort of have seen it throughout spring and it's going to move in towards summer. It all started off with Tom Ford and Chanel at Fashion Week. And it can be a lot more pulled back. So this is Cos and acne, SERDA label, Victoria and words, Zara, Coddanon, they're sort of everywhere. And I think you either love them or you don't. Definitely not new. They sort of play into that nightish space and they've just come back round again. So next off is Monochrome. So pallets were largely neutral at Fashion Week. Sort of rethinking that every day wardrobe. It's all around that clean silhouette. And that doesn't mean that sort of bright bowl colors out. They're always going to be around and always going to be big in spring summer and high summer. So think A's chic. I did some mood boards on TikTok. You want to go check them out. But this sort of vibe with like the lighting. This is from Dish. We'll also see lots of red and roses like this sort of red in the latest Oritan campaign. And roses really in a form of texture. And also the rosettes. This started as a microchran, but it's sticking around and it will come through to summer. Is that red again from SERDA? Mon red, Australian brand are also doing it. I'm out of time, but also fringe and some really short shorts. And also the no shorts look. But I'll do a pat too."," Seven of the hottest spring fashion trends for 2023. Let's get into it. Now some of these trends are really not gonna last and some of them really well. So you're gonna wanna stick around. Number one, the long leather trench coat. Specifically in black now, this is not something new. There are many people that wear this and this is their aesthetic. But in terms of what's hot and trending in fashion, this is becoming a lot more mainstream. Especially when you start seeing, you know, a lot of the TikTok release wearing it and you see 10 variations on Zara. That's when you know it's kind of become a mainstream trend. It is very hot. It will continue for a couple seasons more but I don't think you should spend a fortune on the leather version and I also don't think you should spend anything on the plastic fast fashion version. If you love it and it's worth it for you, then definitely you should get it. Number two, we have denim on denim. Specifically denim suits, oversized denim blazers with matching denim pants and just generally denim. Lots of denim, denim on denim. In this photo, a good transition to number three, which is floral, apple case, just like flower details on everything. This is something I first saw with Magda Boutram. This is kind of like her aesthetic for the last few seasons and I feel like it's becoming more mainstream. I don't think that this is going to last that long. So I really don't think you should spend so much money on a leather flower choker by Saint Laurent because this is kind of more like a fad. I really don't think this is going to carry over for many more seasons. I think at the end of the day, and I say this with everything, if you love something, you should rock it, whether it's in style or not. But if you want to be on trend and you kind of like what's happening right now and you like to be current, this does seem like it will date by the next season. Number four, more low-key, quiet, and conspicuous fashion, which I did touch on a couple of videos ago. This is going to be a big trend now and going forward. This has been going on already. It's going to continue going on more and more. I think people will be less inclined to wear big in your face logos like the Alexander McKaylay era of Gucci and kind of be more subdued, more quiet with their fashion. The rich still rich still spending money more on brands like Cuchinelli, Laura Piano. Just think in general, people's aesthetics, whether it's no brand or name brand is going to be more understated and conspicuous fashion. Number five, big bags, bigger bags, really big bags, which I've been talking about for at least a couple seasons already and I said they're coming back. They're pretty much back, but still kind of trickling along, not quite super mainstream, but you will see more and more big bags going forward. Spring 2023, on to fall winter and on to the next season and season after that, because this is going to be a lasting trend. Do you guys know I'm Olsen Twin era for life, so I am so into this. Cargo pants very much still a thing, so I don't even want to talk about it that much, but I will say cargo shorts, Bermuda cargo shorts, very hot trend coming through, but this is really not going to work for everyone. I know sometimes you guys don't like to hear it, but someone like me who's five three, I could never wear this trend because this really is made for the tall girlies. I'm so sorry, love it though. Cargo pants though, we love those for everybody and you're going to see so many variations of Cargo pants in different ways, vibrant colors, denim of course, silky satins, different fabrics, just like a good, very wearable trend. And number seven, long loose pleated puddled slacks. I love this trend, very kind of androgynous for the girlies kind of gender neutral, great trend for everybody across the board. It's a cool different take on like a casual baggy denim. It's just a little more elevated, still very casual, can dress it up, can dress it down. We'll last a few seasons, love this trend so much. That's it for today, my children. Make sure you follow because I do videos like this all the time and hit me up on Instagram because that's where I could be found in case, you know, I love it kids."," These are the top 15 fallen winter 2022 fashion trends, according to Vogue. Based off of the runway, our stone list is new classics, which is essentially just the white tank tops. It's a staple and grateful layering. Number two is transparent evening dresses. They mentioned it specifically in black and intentionally worn over undergarments or lingerie. And described it as somewhere between elegance and sexiness. This one's a little less see-through but still see-through. Number three is schoolgirl, berries, school uniform vibes. They specifically mentioned the blazer, white shirt, skirt, and trousers, and the tie. No, we were all thinking it. I think it's really cute and really ties into the preppy vibe we've been seeing a lot of. Number four, corseted ball counts. Basically, lots of boning, invisible corset detail. Like this. This and the few that I just showed are a lot more wearable than this, like for part two."," Fall 2022 fashion trends from a New York City fashion stylist. First off, we are talking lace and I mean a lot of it. They're released hats. They're released jackets. Yes, they were even lace pants. These are my favorites. If you were someone who was not into the corset trend, that's already been happening. I hate to tell you, but it's gonna be even bigger for fall. All corsets don't have to look like one dress though, so this one from Fendi is already built into the top. You could also take notes from Gucci by layering over a dress."," There are five summer 2022 fashion trends that I've been loving. Number one, crochet or crochet sets. Crochet is a great way to wear nits in the summer because it's so intricate and it's so breathable. Next up, mid-rise bottoms. As much as I love high-rise, sometimes it cuts your torso too short. When you wear mid-length tops with mid-rise bottoms, it elongates your torso and that is so flattering. Next up, mid-length tops. I am pretty sick of showing my entire mid-drift at all times, so mid-length tops is the perfect medium. Next up, monochrome. If you don't want to buy sets, you can easily recreate it with monochrome sets. This is such a clean look and costs minimal effort. Lastly, cargo pants, specifically the ones that are wide-leg and don't send jet the bottom. You can dress them up or down. They become one of my essentials. I have more of these. Stay tuned for part two."," popcorn top is making a comeback. Let's discuss. Formally known as the Magic Bubble sure, this top was wildly popular in the early 2000s and has been making a resurgence both on the runway and in the slow fashion community due to its wide availability on the second hand market. The wave they showed us these last year and this past spring summer 2022 season designers like Green Sare and Chet Low under the non-profit talent incubator fashion ease showcase the popcorn top. This time super reimagined and funky. The best part it's completely thriftable we know what you think."," If you want to be one of the first people to jump on 2021 fashion trends, keep on watching. Okay, so remember, all those ugly gaps left here, it's where you used to wear when we're 70 years old. Yeah, well they're coming back, so pull them out of your closet and bring them out next year. Also, these bandanas were super in style in the summer and they're staying in style. And then these types of fun pants are staying in style and there's so many different types of them. And they're just very fun. So dress them up, dress them down, make them cute. Make sure you're following my page for more fashion tips."," fall basic pieces you need in your closet. First up, just a good tight turtleneck that you can wear under anything like this in all the colors. Also a more quality knit turtleneck, and of course just some good solid long sleeves for layering. Or if you live in warmer climates like me, just some good solid tank tops that you can wear under jackets without dying of a heatstroke. This is the year of the leather pants they go with anything and take any outfit to the next level. Just a good card again, I have this exact varsity style one and I love it. You'll already know some kind of oversized blazer, enough said. Some sort of heavy cable knit sweater, this is such a staple, but I feel like having that extra heavy knit just really takes it to the next level. A good simple button up shirt, some sort of flared or wide leg leggings really just take any casual outfits to the next level. A good statement jacket or coat that can be dressed up or down. And I feel like this one kind of goes without saying, but black denim jeans complete any fall wardrobe."," Hi everyone, so I'm gonna show you some vibrant summer outfits and I've got a couple picked out so I thought why not? Why not show it? So first off is this green dress from Zara that had this never-cullard as well, really basic and super super cute. I'm gonna show you with jacket. So this denim jacket is from New York and I just want to, I feel like I'm popping in this. Like I would never normally put this together but you know them vibrant people who see this gram. It's gonna be me, it's gonna be me. And I would wear white airfoil so white converse with this. Or black if I had a black bag. Next up I've got this set from Zara, my airfoil and white socks and not gonna lie. I forgot cold. I would put this cord right off the shirt on from Zara. This outfit is so sick. Next I've got this stunning set also from Zara and I would put on this denim jacket from New York. This is just like super cute like I'm really mad with this. And look, even cigarettes! Let me know if you want a part too guys. Bye!"," Alright, so we've been talking about like the psychedelic kind of abstract pattern scene for spring and summer 21 like this or even a little Preppy revive I know people are afraid of pattern because it's hard to style it and these patterns aren't subtle They're very in your face. So this is my series of making spring and summer trends a little less scary Let's try to style it. This is a piece I've picked up which I feel like fits the vibe abstract kind of past Steley almost a little preppy and if you've seen my other spring trends videos It's got that color and a cutoff So here it is We got a lot going on a lot of color, but I do see black in here So black can kind of neutralize it out and make it a little less scary So although we're using black and these use skirt to keep it summery. Okay, so I tucked it in You can untuck it if you want and the skirts that little asymmetry going on keep the interest going and then I think to keep it Gurly and kind of summary I'm gonna use these sandals and look at how cool they are very futurist which almost ties into like the undertone of psychedelic no one's allowed to look my toe is but here they are Then for accessories I added this headband kind of matches the lighter pink going on in here And then I added this mini purse. I think it's a perfect mix of futuristic and",,,,
,," There is really one brand that's setting all the trends at the moment in the past few years as well and that's Mu Mu. And you said they had their full windows show in here, the trends that we can analyze it, I think we'll be seeing in the next few months. They've really been successful in the last few years compared to a lot of other luxury brands. They've set trends such as the mini skirt, as well as shirts and ties, as well as the Mu Mu Boy look. From the turns of the show yesterday, it was very earthy, sort of muted and very retro inspired colourings. A trend that we're going to be seeing is midi skirts. I think it has this really classy edge that will be seen all round through all fashion brands. And especially pairing with either high socks or high boots will be a big trend. And I think it's really crossing into this from girl to woman sort of feel. Another trend that I think we'll see is a lot of glitter, more so in pants and excessurising with different textures like mismatchings. We'll do the fur for example in here. There's a real focus on simplicity but still trying to incorporate it with accessories as well as textures."," Take out your notes, listen to me and I promise you'll look cool this winter. I feel like people don't really talk a lot about winter fashion. We hear a lot about summer fall, especially, but not a lot about winter. And there's so many cute things you can do in the winter time to be fashionable and good. So let's get into it. Now we are not getting into things that you may know, like those fur jackets at Target. Everyone's buying for whatever reason and you know, the fur hats, like everyone knows about that. We're getting things that you haven't seen before. Starting with types of sweaters. They're called fair-eye-al- sweaters and that's when they have the cute little snowflake and the pattern knitted it into them. I love them. Cozy. They can be super chic. One like this too is really fun. I love brown. Brown is very in this season as well. So this is perfect for that. Next are balaclavis. Like this one wouldn't it be so cute with your little fairy princess, snow, makeup, like, so precious and you're for coats that you're all loving. Also go super well with this. It can look super chic with the right pair of sunglasses. You don't have to wear something with a hood. You can just put it on your favorite jacket or whatever. I have had these for a while now, but I think they're going to make a huge comeback. Super bright, big scarves. And then also in regards to scarves, scarves that like match your shirt or like a scarf that comes with a shirt. A shirt scarf situation if you will. Something else that I've been seeing a lot of is colored corduroy and also like monochrome corduroy outfits like this one. Also the one that Kendall Jenner wore. Everyone loves this one. This one is perfection. I love this outfit. And on that note as well with the Kendall Jenner outfit, Moher is back for this year as well. It was a really popular last winter and I think it's going to be really popular at this winter again. Like something like this too, super super cute. And this as well. And we also have, of course, caring from the fall. It's weighed accessories like bags and boots. And jackets and belts. I love matching a jacket to a belt. It's not. Also really putting sweaters that kind of are like full body coverage and specifically ones that are ribbed in like the belly area. And one like I'm wearing mirror wrist to your mid arm. Those I've seen a lot of. I love them. They are so flattering and so beautiful and very timeless. And here's another cute outfit with corduroy for a jacket. You get the vibes. That's all I have. Let me know anything that you guys think I missed in the comments. Love you."," What cool girls will be wearing for fall 2024, part six. Baggy on baggy styles, specifically with skirts and sweaters. I just think it's so chic while also being extremely comfy. Such a great way to keep utilizing the skirts we get in summer for fall. I also recommend getting some skirts and more fall-friendly colors kind of like this. If the solid skirt and the sweater feels a little bit too much for you, I highly recommend going with a lace skirt, kind of break it up. Dark browns, and past years we've really been leading into gray, so I'm really happy to see brown having its moment. I especially love the brown denim. Nothing is better than a dark brown jacket. Brown skirt and trench coat with the suede boots is just too good. Clutch purses. You can go more slouchy like that suede clutch or go a little bit more dinty like this. This trend is almost more about how you hold your purse opposed to actually being a clutch. It gives an office that's a relaxed but elevated look. Writing boots. It's a little bit of an edginess to an outfit. You can go with a classic black writing boot and pair it with an oversized leather jacket. Or go with a dark brown and I really love them paired with a mini skirt."," Fashion trends are gonna see more of this summer starting with the denim corset. Denum tops like this, and we're already gaining popularity. Last summer, they're just really, really trendy, even more so now, they'll be seeing a lot more of them this season. And this one's from Glorage, it was about 35, 40 bucks. Another trend which involves denim funky jeans, kind of like these, these two-tone diagonal waistline, there are so many different variations of cool, trendy, funky jeans that are just a little bit of a different take on a classic straight leg crop leg denim. And these are by Veechi and they're about 40 or 50 bucks. Another trend, denim on denim, it doesn't even have to match, denim on denim. Ballet flats also, still going very much strong. Now we're seeing a lot of ballet flats with the Mary Jane strap, so cute, sharp left turn. Feathers, feather details, feather collars, just feathers. Also sheer, this top is by La Pointe, I don't know, wasn't she? Was on sale though. The Bermuda shorts, still a thing, not my thing, but still a thing. It's very weird this season with the shorts because everything seems to be trending at the same time. Bermuda shorts, but then like mid-thigh shorts that are kind of like still long. And then also super short shorts, just under the tush, short shorts. Another huge denim trend is the Barrel balloon parachute jean happening for a few seasons now, but becoming more and more popular, super, super trendy, you're gonna be seeing a lot more of these. Some of these are wild and crazy, but limiting out to here, fire hazard, giving stock drop and roll. Some of these are wild, relax. These are Bizarra from like four years ago, also like 50 bucks. Oh, one more thing, skinny belts, skinny belts. These are just, some of the trends will be seeing a lot more of this summer, but you know what I always say? It does not matter. Where would she want, whether it's on trend or not? It doesn't matter. I love your kids."," Here's what the cool girls will be wearing this spring. Balloons curts or bubbles curts. Definitely see lots of balloons curts this season in the meaty length, also the mini ones. You can find the cutest ones at Bell Delaybow, also at this brand right here. Another thing all the cool girls will be wearing are shorts and pants from Adidas. I absolutely love when they're paired with more girly elements like the ballerina flats or a cute top like this, and I love when they're paired with heels. They're very easy to find in vintage and secondhand shops, but you can always find them at the Adidas website, also Zalando. Another super cute thing for spring are the scrunchies. These can spice up any outfit, making it look a lot cooler and interesting. You can find the best ones at Good Squish, and also at JetPortus Celia. I don't know if that's how you pronounce them. Still talking about accessories, we love a cap. These are the perfect element for color coordination. Sunny R outside, so it's definitely functional. You can find some cute ones at Division, and at Von Dutch, but the best ones are always"," I would throw this winter style bundle edition. I'm shopping for a client today, but I wanted to show you how much she paid I think gray is really in so when I saw that slip dress and you should unit it this beautiful vintage sweater She loves Carolyn Kennedy, so this black turtleneck a linen blouse this beautiful black dress a couple of blazers And then a trench coat that will never go out of style.

Here was her final review. Then I'm like it's like she's shopping in my brain"," 2023 Trans Part Three. The low waist trend is fully going strong and you don't need to be self-conscious about it because now long tops are in so people are doing long tops and low bottoms. Crap tops are still going to be in, they always have a time and a place, but I'm loving this. I'm also loving how the drop waist is moving towards dresses too. It just gives a new shape and style and elevates the look a little bit. I have a dress very similar to this and it's just so chic and elegant. I love it. The tailored workwear aesthetic is still going strong and I really love it. I think it's so important to get pieces that fit you well and have amazing tailoring and then you can kind of pair them with more casual pieces to elevate that look a little bit. The Dita sambas are still going strong too and I love them. I'm thinking about getting myself a pair. You can also elevate the blazer for a night out. You only really need one black blazer and you can wear it so many ways. I think investing in a good one is so important. One trend that not enough people do that I absolutely love are wearing black and navy together. I think it's one of the easiest ways to look chic and people think it's like breaking the rules but I think it looks so amazing. I think it's the perfect trend for fall and winter and I'm going to be wearing this combo nonstop."," 2023 styles and trends. These are styles that I've had my own that I plan to recreate this summer. Pinterest edition did find some very similar and some exact pieces on my Amazon and you can find that on my store for it under summer fonts. Jumping into it one of my favorite and I feel like one of the easiest looks you can do just a structured short navy is my jam this summer, a navy bottom or navy top or a navy dress but navy.

Obsessed an all-white set I've been looking for one just like this that would come like together I found separates but I'm still on the hunt for a set so I'll let you know if I find one. Like me and you don't like a ton of your arm showing I thought about doing like one of those sheer floral tops underneath. I love this I love a summer maxi summer midi floral dress they just scream summer. I love the tie detail on the shoulder I think it's precious. More floral I'm just obsessed with floral for this season I just cannot get enough. Love the dress like the mini dress or midi with a cowboy boot coastal cowgirl here we go.

Number one bright colors bright pink, Kelly green, all the bright colors are back and I am so here for it this spring. Number two, wide leg pants. So if you're needing to update your jeans, this is a great time to do it. There are tons of new silhouettes out there and wide leg pants and jeans are totally on trend. Number three, trench coats. And I hesitate to say this because they're such a classic, but trench coats are having a moment this spring. Who knew? Number four, metallics. I love a good metallic shoe. So grab yourself a pair of gold or silver sandals. They're going to be in style this spring and you're going to be able to wear them the whole way through. Number five is Raffia. So you're going to see this textural, neutral on everything from shoes to headbands, earrings, belts. It's all over the place."," First I apparently have gotten a better job in my life than Liam Bed on Halloween. I thought I'd predict fashion trends for Winter 2020. I have no idea what I'm talking about, like literally none. Blumers, maybe in. Like I'm picturing cute blumers, socks, loafers, opaque tights, a cute top. I have no idea why I've never even considered wearing blumers before, but I'm searching. I cannot find any to save my life. But I just have this image in my head of wearing blumers, cute tights, loafers, socks, like I don't know what I'm wearing on the top half, but I just think it'd be such a cute outfit. I ain't got a clue what I'm talking about. But I'm picturing this dress, like see this one and like just the top half is the same as one. If that makes sense with these sorts of shoes, just can imagine everyone. And I think I'm just predicting things that I want to wear. But I'm just like seeing like streets, like going to London, everyone's in like long sleeve, like not when's Adam's what's a name. Like everyone's given more Tisha Adams, but with like a boot. I don't know why, but I've just got that vision. Like everyone's going like, because you know the trend right now is to kind of look almost like home-ness, but like not home-ness. You know what I mean? That sounds really bad to say. But like everyone's just going to be really classy and like, I don't know. Maybe that trends too quick to turn around. But I've just like got this vision. But then in like contrast that I think everything's going to be really ugly too. Again, nothing to prove or justify this thinking. Like this sort of knitwear, I can just see being everywhere. Again, is this thing that I want to wear? Probably. That's one I'm projecting. See this one down here? Everyone's going to be stuff like that or like really ugly Christmas jumpers. Like as grandma, grandpa, puppy, as you can get like everything just like ranked. So it's kind of already a trend, but like I'm thinking on steroids. Again, don't come for me. I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm bored and I just couldn't get blumers out of my head. I just couldn't get them out my head."," micro trends that you don't need to buy anything new for. The first is the colour brown, embraces look by going head to toe tonal, or given nod to the trend by just using accessories or a single brown piece. Micro trends tend to be classic pieces that are having a moment in the spotlight. Another example of this are hair bows. Go for something more statement like this and wear it in the evening. The perfect way to add a trend-led twist to your classic pieces, this means you don't have to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe in order to feel on trend. You can also do this look in the daytime with something slightly more subtle. I think the key is to keep the outfit feeling classic and polished and let the bow do the talking. And last micro trend today is dark denim. Again this is probably something most of us already own, but it's having a real spotlight moment. You could do this in the form of these wider legs which give it a 70s twist, or you could go for straight leg denim or a dark denim shirt. Follow for more tips."," 2022 fashion trends from you already know a fashion major. Part five. First up we have bigger bags. We've been all about the cute little shoulder bags for the past couple years, but we're definitely seeing much larger bags coming back. Definitely lots of hobo style bags. And I'm also seeing a lot of these straw or wicker bags. What I'm starting to see more of in shoulder bags is just bigger and longer, but still a shoulder bag. That does not mean that the cute little shoulder bags are just going to go out or that you should stop wearing them. I'm definitely still going to be wearing mine. Next up is face prints. Literally faces as a print. Four faces kind of worked into the print. It's very Y2K so surprise, surprise. Very similar eye print. You've got to be honest when I first saw these I thought they were kind of creepy. But now I like them, like for Part 6.", spring trends where the Fono Book it had were huge last year. This year we're gonna see a lot of knit ones. Also gonna see Maxi skirts make fair return. I love them and this fabric cutouts will for sure be bad especially on dresses. So I'm gonna see a ton of kitten heels which I honestly used to hate. Now I love them in a vintage-y summer kind of way. So lean Ava Bag is one of my favorites this season obsessed with the structure. I mentioned this before but bell sleeves are making a comeback like for the next part.," Winter 2021 and 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major. First up, y'all already know what fur trim coats are everything this season. Similarly, any fur trim sweater, I actually rented this exact one. Just about everything about this, the fur coat, the super dramatic fur hat, the stockings, and the super chunky heels. And of course, we have feathers. And just about anything feather trimmed. Going with that, this wispy feathery material, I think we're about to see much more of. Next up, the aviator jacket. It is so popular this year and with good reason, I love just about anything with cheerling. Speaking of cheerling, just about anything with cheerling. Like bags, shoes, which brings us to moon boots and yes, for practicality reasons, but also just for fashion. It's giving very ugly vibes."," Okay guys, these are gonna be Fall 2021 trends from a fashion major. Part two. Okay, I mentioned these at the end of my last video, but they definitely need to be talked about more, and that is Cowboy Boots. As a native Texan, I am just so happy about this one. This fall, I think we'll be seeing them done in a lot more colors and patterns like these. Whether you like it or not, low-rise students are having a comeback, love the way they look, hate the way they feel, but they're gonna be here. We're gonna be seeing a lot of matching business suits. Especially skirt suits, I am simply obsessed. This one's not a set, but just beaded in metallic bags are going to be huge. This fall in winter, especially little statement ones like this. Unfortunately, this one isn't that practical, but they definitely can be. Oversized button-ups are gonna be an absolute staple this fall. You definitely need one in your wardrobe. This one might be my favorite, but the preppy style is going to absolutely take over the inner-blare walldorf and all of us will be thriving. Monochromatic fits are gonna be where it's at. Magenta and pink are also gonna be huge. Like, so good.", Summer trends worth the many dresses aren't anything new. And we're gonna see them in a lot of unexpected patterns. Floral tops are gonna be literally everywhere. And I know you don't wanna hear those but pebbles are coming back. We're gonna see a lot of mixing of bright and bold colors. I am obsessed. Summer boots are very much a thing. It's such a key trend that it's almost worth sweating your balls off for. Like for the next part.," Trendy shoes for spring and summer, let's go! I like to call these polypocket shoes. Every girl is living out her polypocket dream here by wearing shoes like this. I literally think every website will probably have these within the next month. Cowboy boots are not kidding. Cowboy boots can be very very expensive, so if you don't think you'll wear them, I don't think it's a good investment. Honestly, I think they're super cute with dresses though. Obviously, converts are always in, but I feel like a lot more platform styles are going to be in as well as brown, and as well as pink and other pastels. I have so many more ideas for spring and summer, so let me know if you want to see them.",,,,
,," Spring trends are out. We've seen the runways. Let's see some spring 2025 fashion trends that you can do off an Amazon. You guys know the drill. I found it the best, the cutest and the most affordable outfits. So you can lick your best this spring and summer. Let's get into it. Spring 2025 is all about knitwear, coursing floral details, but more so built into the actual fabric. I absolutely love this. Perfect for both spring and summer. Everyone looks so good on this. I know that we're seeing polka dots as a huge trend this spring and summer 2025. And I absolutely love this top there so much to it. And to get this whole look, we're in a pair with this MaxiSkirt. I absolutely love the Sat MaxiSkirt trend that we're seeing. We're going to be seeing them everywhere. Every single color but black is the staple. You can also expect to see knits like this. I think it's so beautiful for spring and summer. You can wear them in so many ways with loafers, slip-ons, kitten heels, everything. But our yellow is one of the biggest trending colors that we'll be seeing for spring fashion trends. So this bag is perfect and so petite, so cute. Spring fashion trends, we're seeing shoes take on a more slim look so you'll continue to see the gazelles, the thambos, all of those good things. I think that this colorway is so perfect for spring. On that same note, I love this because we're also seeing the low-rise MaxiSkirt as well. For spring outfits, we're going to see a lot of structured materials, even though the material will be getting shorter and smaller. I love this set so much. We've seen lots of S and lots of workwear turn preppy. And loafers will surprisingly be one of the itchews for spring. I absolutely love this. The girlies are styling these in so many cute ways, so I would pair this with this. I think that would be so cute. We'll also be taking this look that we started to see last spring and summer. We'll continue to see in sets like this. It's just so great for street style. I love this. Sneakers or the little kitten heel. The great way to wear the box we're trying to also without it being too cold. We'll see lots of bar and jackets this spring because the fishermen aesthetic absolutely loved the cropped version. I think we'll continue to see them more cropped in a little more structured. Jellies and Pearl Essent materials are absolutely even over spring trends in spring outfits this season. I love the snack list. I have it on the way. It's such an easy way to elevate an outfit. Making it a little more interesting. I think they're so beautiful."," Girls girls don't get cute trends from other girls, which is why we don't get cute over here. Here's the 2024 Winter Fashion Trends you absolutely need to know about. This has been in the trend cycle for a minute, but it's definitely exploded recently. First up, we have this Bayonetta office siren glasses trend. I'm sure you've been seeing this everywhere because it is such a popular trend right now. It's based off the characters, like its namesake here, Bayonetta, all around it, or square frames that were super popular before with celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Megan Faw. It's even been recently worn by celebrities like Bella Hadid. It's giving like sexy, liberating, and coarse. Obsessed. New Mew have definitely been the go-to brand for this trend, but I also really love this red and black pair from Lexola, and these silver square frames and these gold rounded frames from gentle monster are just too good. I love these. This trend because it's not something that you have to spend a ton of money on, right? Like you can literally just go to the third store. But there's also some lower cost options like these from Glasses USA that are only $30. I love how it's lined in red. These Fendi frames from Smart Buy Glasses that are only $48. These pair from iBuyDirect for only $50. I even have a pair of frames myself. So cute. Just see what else is trending. Make sure you look out for part two."," These are the Euroful Fashion Transprediction for this year. We are doing red cherry like this. I love them combined. It would be very good with Caki. You can have it as a pop of color. The corporate style is going to be big this year. We will see any kind of suits. If everyone are from Revolve and Reformation, this style is not only effortless but also very classy. Get ready to incorporate the British countryside on Monivive. Very popular. We will have Berber jackets and tweed blazers. Next we have high colors. They bigger the better. I found them very chic and classy. And expectantly we will have feathers on almost anything. PJs, skirts and also fur are coming back strong of any kind. Either oversized but also shorts like this. Super chic. We will see barrel leg pants, denim, perfect for my petite girlies. Another strange coming back is the Caki, which I definitely recommend you to style it with brown or gray. Mino if you want part 2."," I've trends we are absolutely doing this spring. The color yellow, the battery yellow is my favorite. We will be seeing pretty much every shade. You may not want to hear this, but we are definitely doing purple. This is so flattering. Guys take yourselves away too seriously. And I say this is someone who also did it the first time around. And over. Metallic sneakers, I mean, need I say more. Partigans as tops. This is such an easy way to incorporate a trend without needing to buy anything new. Neahyesauk, the preppy era is coming back in a new way that I think is so cheap, like for the next part."," If this is your vibe per spring 2024 but you don't know where to start, here's a couple things that you may want to incorporate in your closet. First off, you're going to need a killer blazer. This is the Eriksia Agency Blazer. It's the perfect mix between a business-y blazer and a boyfriend blazer, perfect for day or night. You're also going to want to get a pair of blue jeans with no rips, so these are my favorite. They are the Levi's ribcage. I love them. But you're also going to want a pair of trousers. These are way comfier than jeans in my opinion. These are the effortless pants from Eriksia. Get them in black, get them in white, get them in whatever color you want. They're amazing. Get yourself some basic t-shirts as well. A black or a white crew neck. Also get a long sleeve while you're at it so you can layer up. There are lots of spring jackets to choose out there. I say start out with the trench coat to really elevate your style. This one is from Egenem and it's under $100. Lastly, get yourself a pair of nice new clean sneakers for the new season. We all know and love the Adidas Sambas but any sneaker that you're comfortable with will do. Follow for part two."," It's officially cold in New York City so I thought timing was appropriate here for cool girl winter trends. I want to emphasize cool girl so you either dress like this or want to dress like this. Number one is for coats. I know this doesn't come as a first to anyone. We all knew this was coming. I just want to remind you how cool fur coats are and how much you need one. You can wear them with sweatpants, exhibit bean, and sea, or you can dress it up. And they can be long or short. Look at how cool this outfit is. Take it in. It can even better if the coat has a hoodie. Fur is at this winter so try number two is fur hats. And I know we saw these last year but I didn't see enough of them. So I encourage you to participate. It can be a headband of sorts like this or a bucket hat wrapped in fur. Like this or a full Alaska coverage your ear kind of hat like this. And if you have heel boots decorated with fur in some way, you have one winter. These will make you the egg girl. I'm obsessed. Let it be clear. I don't mean this. I don't mean yety boots. Another cool boot option is this. Moving on trend number three is tights. I'm sure some of us have already seen this trend but again, I'm here to remind you of how cool it is. Burgundy is the color of this winter so you won't go wrong with burgundy tights in a black outfit or white. Another example. I don't know what you call them. I call them lace tights. But there are also another good option. You can see them peaking and this. My two favorites are gray tights. So cool. Yes. And yes. And thick brown tights. I love an all brown outfit. Green tights is something. I don't know if I'm ready for it. However blue tights like this. Zendaya gave us to go ahead on blue tights so I think yes. I'm a huge fan of big top a little bottom so this is a way to do it this winter. And my last trend is leg warmers. There's different ways you can wear this. Way number one the most basic is wearing them under your boots. Like this. And this. This. And this. Way number two is over sneakers. Like this. And this. Way number three is over heels. Like this. And this. Gray way to wear your kitten summer heels in the winter. And this. And this. And this. Summer wearing them over uggs. I hate uggs so I won't speak on it. And the fourth way is wearing it as a sock. You don't need a leg warm or you can just wear a cool sock. Like this. And this. And this. Okay but don't do this you'll look like a retired ballerina in a bad way. Do this instead. Okay that is all for my cool girl winter trends. I mean now if you'd like me to share my favorite leg warmers and tights that I use. They're great they're from Amazon and they cost me six dollars. I hope this was helpful and informative."," tragic news, but I have been thinking a lot about fall 2023 fashion, even though we're in peak summer because it is coming, whether you like it or not. Let's go through all of my inspiration. So the number one trend, I think we're going to see this fall is 70s inspired fashion and silhouettes. So this is my favorite example of it because it's still very modern and muted, but we can see the 70s inspiration here with the bell bottom jeans and the billi-lea silhouette on top. Also, I think that these exaggerated boots are going to be a big this season, whether it's a square toe or a pointed toe. Just an exaggerated boot is going to be a big thing this fall. Newing on with 70s inspiration. I mean these colors just scream 70s to me. I think they're the perfect summer to fall transition colors because they're still bright and fun, but they're leaning muted and that more fall color palette with the coral and the mustard yellow instead of like an orange and that light baby. Yellow everyone's been loving. I also think we're going to see a ton of these scarves this fall, especially early fall before we actually need like knit scarves to stay warm. The silk scarf tied around the neck, I think that's going to be big. They for 70s, I mean I think that these floral quilted jackets they've been around for a minute now, they just scream 70s to me. I think they're the perfect transitional piece and I think paired with this kind of mustard yellow bag, it just screams transition from summer to fall to me. Next, I love a monochrome outfit and if you want to transition out of the pure white monochrome outfit, I think fall is the perfect time to do all cream. I don't personally care about not wearing white after labor day, but I think if you do, this is a great option. And if you're more into color, I love this monochrome look. I love the plaid. Again, that feels very 70s, it feels like a fall pattern. The color is still fun and summery and you can just pop this wetter off if it gets warmer later in the day like it usually does in the fall time. I also love that these are not perfectly matched. I personally much prefer a monochrome look. That's a little bit mismatched because I just think it's more authentic and shows more personal style if you ask me. And finally, my favorite genre of outfit in the fall time are outfits that simply don't make sense otherwise. This outfit, it's like a mini skirt, she's like covered on top, has boots on, weather-wise. This makes zero sense, but because the fall has pretty neutral weather, at least here on the east coast, you can get away with wearing this and you can be it pretty comfortable. And it's like how often do we get to wear these types of things paired together on these coasts, not very often. And the same genre of outfit, we have the little denim, booty shorts, the boots, and then a sweater on top. This is my favorite outfit, I think I want to recreate something like this. I think it's so cute, it doesn't make any sense, and I love it. This is all saved on my Pinterest, it's in my bio, let me know if you want more."," Here at the top 10, spring summer 2023 trends that you need to know brought to you by Vogue. And you can shop them all right now. First stop is pocket change, which we've all seen before, but now the cargo style is going beyond pants. We're seeing styles like this Miyu Miyu set. They took their core mini skirt and made utilitarian and added that vest and really evolving this trend. Next up is pillow talk. Re-imagined core sets. Majorius underpinnings and sheer evening gowns, like this top from Paco Reban. You can style with a silk mini skirt or even a pair of distrust jeans. Totally see this trend becoming that relaxed, cool girl summer look. Next up, or denim. Know what you're thinking? We've seen this trend season after season. But still, designers are coming through with some unique stuff. Really love this piece by J.W. Anderson. It's a unique take and lends itself to our next trend. Runs revisited. Maybe because I grew up in the 90s, but I will never get tired of grunge. I think this Miyu Miyu look really represents this new trend. Versed at like effortless, downtown energy with the layers, the loose fit and a touch of masculinity. But we all know those jewels apply to what sets me off. Shuffs kiss. I think we all know who laid the groundwork. And thanks to Batega, flannel is going to be an object of desire. And that's it for part one. Follow along for part two."," Spring 2023 trends that I am here for. The first is just an overall green trend. I get if it's not your thing because green has really never been my like go-to color when it comes to fashion, especially like this kelly green or a bright green. For some reason this spring I am so about it. Specifically when it comes to accessories. The options are endless. Next is sheer everything. Love sheer tops. Like you can wear a sheer t-shirt and automatically you look dressed up. That's an actual life hack right there so you're welcome."," dress trendy and wintery even if you love some more hot. Part two. And again, I live in Texas, so I know these. First up is incorporating cheerling. The earling is one of those things that just screams winter. And I'm not saying get a big cheerling coat but incorporated into things to like a cheerling bag. It has a very wintery feel to it, even though it's just a bag. It just makes your outfit feel and look more wintery. Next, a big trend right now, both. Again, this one just feels wintery. I don't know what it is about it. Maybe that's just me. But again, I think it's very easy to incorporate. Next up, I feel like I don't even need to explain this one but sweater vests. Kind of going with that incorporating knit of any kind. Especially the see through knit that's really trendy right now. It's so breathable. And it's technically still a sweater. So next up are skinny scarves. Especially in a little matching set like this. Again, so trendy. Here, me out on this one. Leather, not leather pants. We all know you would die somewhere hot. But again, just incorporating it, especially-"," Americana fashion is on the rise again, so let's talk about it. When I think of Americana fashion, I typically think of preppy pieces with a western influence like this Ralph Lauren ad here. I think this is especially apparent in the rise and popularity of cowboy boots. They have been everywhere in street style and runway looks for the past few seasons at least. And I wouldn't be surprised if these boots in the future escalated a little bit. To still a western boot, but with fringe details. And the increase in popularity again of a riding boot style. Traditionally considered maybe more of a preppy item, striped sweaters have been trending this season, especially a quarter zip or colored style, which again invokes more of a preppy vibe. Popping back to this Ralph Lauren ad for just some moment, you can see the whip stitching here on the jacket. And we've been seeing this to a ton of jacket everywhere with a similar vibe with the embroidery detail. I think this sort of whip stitching look will only become more popular."," Emerging women's jewelry chains for summer 2022. The first trend we have is hoops stacking. We've seen this on many influences such as Emma Chamberlain and Kai Gerber. Next, trend we have a belly chains. These have been mostly worn on clothing as an extra accessory. And finally, jump stone necklaces. These are super easy to layer and add a diversity in your drawing. One place I'd recommend this firing since all their pieces are handmade in Melbourne and a water resistance can be worn every day and they also end eternally."," modest fashion trends for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Part two, first up, you already know what the oversized button up. They're so hot this spring and summer, we're gonna be seeing them everywhere and they can very easily be incorporated into more modest looks. I also love this look, we're seeing a lot of this quilted fabric, especially in outerwear. We're also seeing a lot of knit, especially in tops and dresses, I love it. Again, very easy to incorporate, especially into dresses, tops, skirts, like this. So cute. And great for layering. Another one of my favorites, cargo pants. They can be a little more dressed up or down. We're gonna be seeing them everywhere and they're definitely very easy to be paired with something modest. Last and certainly not least is the Matilda Girfastetic. She has created a whole aesthetic at this point and I think it's very easy to be modest with this. There's a lot of looser fitting baggy clothes and there's lots of layering and a lot of midi and maxi dresses and skirts. Like for part three."," and trending for winter 2021 part. One we focus more on like the higher fashion, fashionista, but not everybody wants to spend $2,500 on a Valentino K. And I get that. So what trend happening very much now, carrying over into winter 2021 is the sweater vest. So this trend is a little more mainstream and a little more accessible to the everyday fashionista and depending on how you style it, very, very cool. Other mainstream trend is the cropped cardigan. I love this one, but I would never spend this price point I would like wait for this to go 70 off. There are so many affordable options online, casual and easy to wear for the everyday fashionista. Lastly for this portion is the leather straight leg pant. Again, very mainstream, but still very cool. You don't have to spend $500 on this trend. However, keep in mind that the fast fashion like versions of this, they're never made the same. I would consider a little higher end, maybe middle of the road.", Our funky colorful tights gonna be the It Tren for fall 2021. We saw it on the runway from Prada to Emilio Pucci and Versace and major fashion sources from Vogue to Marie Claire are calling this the most unexpected It Tren of fall 2021. So what do we think? Do we love it? Do we hate it? It's not my personal favorite and you definitely have to style it correctly. Let me know your thoughts in the comments down below.," luxury trends that will be everywhere this summer. Okay, first of all, this designer scarves, and I don't mean scarves in the way that you would traditionally think. I'm actually talking about designer scarves as tops. I know we've been seeing this all over social media for the past few months, but I think that this is going to be a huge trend this summer, and when it's styled well, I think that this one can be really cute. Next up is pastel bags, and I know that pastels have been one of the biggest trends of 2021 so far, and it's not just for clothes, but for accessories as well. A lot of designers have been releasing their popular styles and pastels, so I think this is another one we're going to see a lot of this summer. And last up is bucket hats. I feel like a lot of designers have also been putting out their own versions of bucket hats this year, so I think we're going to see a lot of these this summer. And I'm especially loving a little hat and bag matching moment."," Spring trends toss your key. Very fluff. If it keeps for me, I'm literally obsessed. Satin dresses are a key for me. You know I love these. Golden goose are a toss. I like this guy, but these just give me dirty, little kitchen vibes. You aren't gonna like this, but these are a toss for me. If you like them, do you, they're just not for me. Like for the next part.",,,,
,," my favorite fashion trends for spring 2025. Alcatal is definitely having a little comeback moment. I really love how playful this is without adding too much of pattern because I really don't like patterns on myself. I also love the polka-dot nails everyone has been getting. There's a lot of articles saying that plaid is also a trend. Really, I'm not a very big fan of this but I think it's really, really beautiful for this and skirts. Take it out to a little something to the outfits. Powder paint also having its comeback just reminds me the beginnings of Glossier. This is my favorite color in the entire world. It feels so innocent and sweet while not being too much. Me personally, it's just a perfect shade of pink. And has also been saying boho. What are these runway pictures? Storm Pinterest a lot like me. You've probably seen these and I just think they're really, really iconic. I'm really happy to see this trend. Though this also has happened before. I just really feel like it's very much a 20 to 10s revival kind of theme going on. Last trend that I like that I found a lot is Coastal grandma preppy and then also functional outerwear and combination with that. Which I think is a really, really great trend. It was almost impossible to find real life inspiration for that. This is a PSA. Please start wearing functional jackets and make outfits with them. Just things that work in the brain. I need to up."," I was just stalking Pinterest and this is five trends. I think they're going to be super big this winter. In the fall, this color red was super big. This like bright cherry red, but I think in the winter we're going to move to this more dark maroon color. Just a shade deeper than your fall red. You can see it here on the Hermes runway and Gucci. I love it like full head to toe in this kindle-genre look and I even have it on my nails right now. Moving on. This American Ashley Olsen picture has been going viral because of this really cool sheet of print coat. I can so see like a big sheet of print coat becoming a huge trend. I think it's so bold and so cool, but I think this trend is going to continue even further into just pattern coats in general. Next, a trend that I feel like is a bit more controversial, socks and kitten heels, or ballet flats. I feel like this trend isn't for everyone, but it looks so good when pulled off right. I love it because it's a way we can mirror our fall shoes into winter. Ballet flat is usually too cold for the winter, but throw on a sock and it works. And for a night outlook, I love it with a sheer moment. Next, leather maxi skirts. I fell in love with this Gigi-D look. I feel like this is a great staple piece. Like I could wear this to the office and out to dinner right after. It's such a transitional outfit and even pair with the socks and kitten heels. Last is a really, really big chunky oversized scarf. Worn in almost like a shawl like way. It's almost so exaggerated that your look was going on, but in a cool way. And it's a super fun way to add color into your outfit. And it's practical. What do we think of these winter trends? Do we want a part two?"," 2024 jacket trends you should know about if you don't already. This is the fall the barn jacket It's just a canvas jacket that usually has a cord collar or leather collar being quilted barn jacket When from Everlane is the it barn jacket also be seeing a lot of trench coat especially gavardine one We see trench coats. They're gonna be the main focus of the outfit. Oh, this one almost looks like a dress Especially be seeing these with heel weight is absolutely major this fall This or this back to see this mume one everywhere. This is suede. We're also gonna be seeing a lot of cord Sashley cord blazer. He's seeing cinch waist blazers the most whether that looks achieved by a pebble on bottom Like this. He sleeves, older pads. This is a true cinch waist blazer in general So I'm gonna start seeing some crock jacket. It's safe to say toggle jackets aren't going anywhere anytime soon"," Here's what cool girls will be wearing for spring 2024. Part two, sheer maxi skirts. Now this is a great way to elevate a very, very simple comfy outfit. The sheer fabric just instantly elevates any look. Now you can go more casual with it like an oversized tee or you compare it with a blazer which I think is so, so chic. Like just a difference between this and trousers is insane to me. It's a very simple way to add a layered look to your outfit. Now if the skirt isn't so much your thing, shirt tops are also great and really easy to layer. Belly flats made of come back in 2023 and they are here state in 2024 except we're gonna be seeing them a little bit more elevated. We're gonna see them embellish like this studded pair right here which I think are absolutely perfect. Also gonna see them in metallic colors specifically silver. This is this perfect statement shoe. Lightweight cardigans, they are perfect for transitioning into spring and scream cool girl specifically when you just top the very top button. I absolutely love that look. And it can be worn in so many different ways. You can go with more of a monochromatic look or go for more of a dressy look. I absolutely love the way they look paired with trousers. And cool girls will still be wearing their deutasambas and gazelles. Maybe a bit more controversial but I personally love these styles of shoes and don't think they're gonna be going anywhere anytime soon."," Here's what cool girls will be wearing for spring 2024. Red was super popular in 2023 and it is not going anywhere in 2024, but specifically we're gonna be seeing pops of red with accessories. You can utilize red with hats or shoes and you can never go wrong with a red bag. Striped button ups. Now in 2023, I feel like the craze of button ups was kind of lost, but they're coming back in this year. Full force, but with a striped effect. Really easy to dress down or up, really love them with denim. Button ups are also a great way to utilize color. I absolutely love this red one. One of my favorite ways to style a button up is only buttoning up a few of the buttons and leaving it untucked. I just think it gives this really casual cute look. We're gonna be seeing a lot of cheetah print, especially with jackets and with pants. And if you're not huge into animal print, I think shoes are a great way to style this trend. And speaking of shoes, we're gonna be seeing lots of colorful sneakers. Really, we are unleashing the beast because fashion over the past few years has been so so neutral. So I think this is a great way to double in color. I really love a matching matchy look, but also serve as a really good statement piece."," If you want to jump start on the winter fashion trends, you're gonna want to try these three items next month. Okay, first up, the leather blazer. I've been rocking this actually for the last few weeks and I'm obsessed. So you could try a fitted version like this, a baggy or version like this, or you could do a crop version like this. All right, next up, throwing it back to the 80s with the like warmers. All right, the celebrities have been rocking these in the past month or so and I actually think it looks really cute like this. How cooler are these leather ones? I love these. For just a plain black pair like these. Last up, the white button down shirts which we've been seeing all over the place this fall. They're sticking around but there's also an upgrade to them. So you could always do the classic one like this or you could try a cropped version like this, an extra cropped version like this, or a one piece dress version like this."," If you haven't already noticed, fall 2023 is all about the flat shoe. I'm calling it flat shoe fall. Paraport pairs that I would add to your wardrobe if I was styling you. First up, loafers tend to be the trendiest classic flat there is. They go with everything which explains why they're never out. I recently bought this pair from Zara, and I'm wearing them on a very hot day in Arizona, which again shows that loafers are just a shoe you need to have around. Color specifically is perfect for fall. If you're new to trying the loafered trend, I do think you should start with a classic flat pair. I recently ordered this pair from Cezanne, and I'm so excited to style these. Stay tuned for that. L.A. flat is back. It became a staple piece in every fashion forward girls closet last year, and they show no signs of going anywhere soon. Whether they're a designer pair like this, square toe pair, or more affordable pair which we love, L.A. flats are sure to complement just about any outfit this fall. Then there's mesh flats. Mesh is having a major moment this fall, and I was obsessed with this style in like 2002. Mesh is back, but as you can tell, a more chic version. Thank God. You'll see embellished ones like this. My dream pair. And something a little more simple like these black Mary Jane styled ones. I love these. If you're not ready to commit to the ballet flat trend, don't worry because slingbacks are also having a major moment this season. Slingbacks are definitely more versatile and less trendy. So if you're new to trying trends, I go for something like this. If you're wanting something a little more edgy, I'm obsessed with this pair from Gawney. I'm sure some of you will be happy to know that the Birkenstock clog will continue to be popular this year. So if you already have them, keep them out. If you don't already have a pair, but you're wanting to try some, I would suggest going with this more classic color and style. But if you're wanting to try something different, how cute is this cow print pair? Something a little more forward and try a chunky pair like these ones. As excited as I am for flat fall, I still love a little length to my leg. So I will be reaching for my kit in heels. You know, if you want me to share some of my faves."," These are some of the hottest summer trends for 2023. 90s cult classic the slip dress as seen here on Gwyneth is definitely making a return. I love this silhouette because I personally believe it's never really gone out of style. It's something for me that I'm a 90s gals for a run through. I believe that it can look flattering on anybody type. So the long drains by the silhouette is definitely something that can be super cute for a day look with ballet flats. For me, my personal one of my personal faves is a chunky sneaker and a sock. If you do want a more elevated or evening look though, I would suggest pairing with an oversized laser and a strippy heel like the absolute babe in Rada Hazon and that can take you effortlessly from your day into your night. The next trend that I would be keeping an eye on is the jort. Obviously we are no stranger to the jort. It's not a new trend. It's definitely making a resurgence into the Y2K essentials list for spring summer 2023. You can wear it out of a heliboe with your cute little baby doll top if not your baby doll and you want a more elevated look. Let's say brunch into an early evening dinner holiday mode. I would do a rib tank and a cute oversized shirt. Also very nicely sandals and socks. One of my faves or you can see here with the sunbursts as well. They look pretty dope. I think that the way we can elevate this look as well, again with a strippy saddle, oversized laser or long laying coat and that gives you that really perfect elevated look for the evening as well."," Part two of what I think it girls are gonna be wearing, transitioning into spring. Okay, one of my favorite brands that I think is the definition of what we're gonna see. A lot. It's Simon Miller. Super colorful, super funky, super fun. Love it. The CEO, Chelsea's an icon and I feel like this is a perfect outfit for spring. In my last video, I pointed out how I think we're gonna see a lot of primary color mixed with neutrals, with like a twist of a fun element. I also think we're gonna see a lot of graphic knitted like this sweater and again the fun colorful touch with the little baggie. A lot of flowy outfits. We're gonna see this spring. I feel like the tight, all tight outfits are completely gone. Double denim is gonna be everywhere. Again, we're gonna see a lot of flowy outfits going on, but not in like a shapeless way. If you see this still has a lot of structure. In the last couple weeks, I will say that we saw this switch into the crop tops going lower. High waisted, even like dresses with pants and dresses we'd like long skirts. I think this is so cool. This is a set from Sarah and I think it's very flowy. A lot of shape going on and one point. For sure, this is gonna be the New York City girlies uniform, like maxi skirts or dresses with oversized t-shirt and cowboy boots. This is gonna be the eight girl thing. Like literally this beautiful girl just popped on my for you page on Instagram and wow, like I need to self it now. Here we have Laila Moss already rocking it in New York City and it's like the evolution of the style that we saw a lot this winter, but I feel like we're gonna still see a lot of C-true dresses with like high volume sweaters on top. Of course, these are only my takeouts. I'm not an expert and you can follow any trend or style that you want."," Want to be ahead of the curve? Here's everything you need to know about the trends coming up. Get ready for the rowback season. Think Rachel and Monica from Friends, Sabrina the Teenage, which the late 90s, early 2000s, that's what's coming up. We'll be seeing a lot more of the Polo shirt neckline. Zara actually has a great body suit like this. I got myself one. Dungaries were making a comeback in a mini dress style and the way we used to know them. Maybe just not with as much extra stick on. Stiles basically evolving to a lot more simpler looks. So stuff like a button down shirt and cardigans. You'll be seeing a hella load of cardigans. Some more like a cashmere style. And in the iconic ribbed fabric, my personal favourite. Installed them with the 90s baggy jean trend that has been in with a little bit of a ripped jean or the classic high-waisted mime jean. And it's not even just outfits. It's actually even in all our hair style, the makeup trends that are in, the whole 90s blow out anchor and bangs, which are everywhere. And we can't forget the Polo neck, the high neck, the rollover, whatever you want to call it, in a classic ribbed fabric. By keeping it minimalistic, a classic jumper, a cardigan, high-waisted jeans or some baggy jeans, just wearing the staple core pieces in your wardrobe. And I absolutely love this style. I feel as if we can all find something in our wardrobe from it. If you've saved some of your old stuff and you never throw it out because you're a hoarder like me, maybe steal a couple of pieces from your mom. I absolutely love this trend and I hope it's here to stay."," Hi guys. It's been a minute and I want to chat. Specifically about this cottage core coastal grandma thing we have seen all summer. We've all loved it, we've all seen it. In some way she performed we all tried to do it a little bit this summer maybe. At least I have. But I just saw a TikTok of this girl saying like oh my gosh the end of an era we have to wait till next summer to coastal grandma thing. No. We're gonna wear it into fall and I'm gonna show you how. Also if you're new here. Hi my name's Hannah. I've been a retail buyer of origin retail and I love fashion so let's get into it. The coastal grandma vibe is very neutral. It's very preppy. It's got a lot of great textures like linens and a hundred percent cotton. It's very comfortable and it's very cozy and homey. So yes the linens and the white and natural tones really thrive in the summertime. However you can incorporate this whole vibe into winter. To accomplish the whole vibe the number one thing you're gonna want to have in your closet this fall is a chunky knit sweater. The oversized, the big stitching, the very comfy cozy sweater. Even the thicker tighter knitted together stitching like this I think is just stunning. This whole cream chunky sweater with a perfect blue jean. To me just screams your coastal grandma. The cottage queen Martha herself wearing the light beige sweater and what I will note too is this high neck. I'm originally from Pennsylvania so I know how cold it gets up there. So having a high neck to keep you warm is something so important. Like look at all these ladies. This whole look to me is just so timeless and so stunning and you can wear it all year round. Because it does get really cold layers are also going to be your best friend. I love these two looks right here and I love that she pair just like a very basic white long sleeve red underneath. It's so cute and very similar looks here. So cute. Along the lines of layering too a collar is really good because it keeps you warm and it's also a little bit more stylish than just your basic tea underneath. Again something like this. Also touching on collars a little bit Emma Chamberlain's been wearing them a lot this summer and I think they're gonna be big. And these like collared type sweaters just give the same energy to me. It gives the illusion that it's a collar but it's not. It's just cute. I don't know. I've also been loving different textures and patterns for sweaters too. Patterns like this I just love so much and it kind of keeps with the blue and white striped coastal theme that we see all the time. I've talked about cool thing and it's just gonna be huge but these kind of textures. Very preppy, very nostalgic but also still so unique. It's preppy, it's effortless, it's got a little bit of European, it's a little unique but it's still just so simple. We have so much more to talk about so like for part two. Also if you like this whole vibe I created a board on Pinterest called Coastal Grandma. So go follow me.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," Fashion trends for spring 2022 is flashback to the 80s and gen X nostalgia. It's gonna be a broad mix of things that never happen for a thousand dollars Alex. Vintage clothes you can finally repurpose because you've been hanging on to them for over 30 years. Everything all of this new again. And a dash of whimsy. So the first thing we're going to reintroduce into our wardrobe is a trucker hat, a brand new trucker hat. And you're gonna just want to bend that brim. Now there's a variety of techniques that you can use. I'm just going to do it like a simple one here for you. And then just put it on your head. Dig out of your closet an old hard rock cafe sweatshirt. I think we all have one of these. I've never been to a hard rock cafe and I've never been to Tokyo and yet I have this one. It's got those colors. I've never thrown it out and I found them. And this is the piece that will exist all. The original pair of those stand-its bike shorts that have the seam that go right up the crotch. And then the neon pink or the neon green or the neon orange stripe. It's a good thing you hung on to them because they're back in style. Now to complete the look I'm going to show you the nails. And this is called 100% natural. And for footwear because we're heading into spring and summer we're going with the crocs. But not your grandma's crocs. No, we're going with the more updated modern version of crocs. People won't even know that you're wearing crocs but you can have the comfort. The other thing that is going to make you so fashion forward now especially when you're having those cool summer nights. And you want to just like achieve that aesthetic look is we're going to go back old school and layer our socks. To bring out the highlights of the clothing that we're already wearing. Now you're going to have to get creative because it's very challenging to find socks of these exact same shades. But we're going to do it. So I've used gray and this is mirroring the gray of this sweatshirt. The next thing I'm going to do is layer green. And you know it's not an exact green but you know it's picking up the same vibe. And I only have this pair of pink socks. It has a unicorn on a narwhal on it. But fashion is fashion. And once you have achieved the right layering you just want to just push it down. Which just needs to be that effortless look. Are you ready to see the finished look? The best thing about this look is that you can wear your crocs with it. Look at this."," It is totally about time that I do my fall fashion predictions. I'm gonna do fall slash winter because I feel like they can be kind of combined into one, but this might be two parts just warning you, but I'm gonna try to squeeze as much as I can into this one video. First up on the trend forecast, we have Kelly Green. Kelly Green is going to be the color of the season. It's going to be used in accessories like shoes that you can see here. We have it in these jeans here and then also this trend I'm gonna bring up later, but a bunch of funky knits. So I'm kind of talking about both right now, but... but Poverjackets will be coming back because they're useful, they're cute, but this one in Kelly Green, and I'm telling you it's gonna pop off again this year. So if you had it from last year, you're in luck. Like I mentioned briefly, a lot of funky knits like crazy colors, just like crazy patterns and stuff. And then also this is a runway looks with a little bit dramatic, but chunky knits are also going to be in so beyond just like the colorful crazy patterns. chunky, the chunky are the better. Pretty much in a sweater. I found this sweater from Selfie Leslie, and I think it's so stunning because it has the puff sleeves that have been in trend recently, but it's also just like a very chunky sweater in the sleeves, but then it's still pretty classic. Sherpas are going to be back again, but I think that they're going to be a little bit more wild and crazy than the ones from last season like the one I'm wearing. They're going to be like a little bit more bright patterned, fun, and then of course these ones will be back as well. Here's a really cute example of a Sherpa jacket from its Juliet. I actually ordered this one and it's in the mail, so I'm so excited to get it, but it's kind of like patchwork, but not like the cringey patchwork, and then Sherpa and denim. But because I just mentioned denim, denim will also be huge this fall and winter. I feel like we're going to see the Canadian tuxedo, but not just your typical Canadian tuxedo only. Stuff like this where it's a little bit more funky, jazzy, like this isn't like a full Canadian tuxedo has some like pattern going on. Okay, also if you live in a warm climate, this might be good for you. This kind of trend is going to be huge again as well. So it's kind of like the glove trend, but like making it useful because you can't really wear gloves everywhere you go. So the sleeves that are detached from the shirt and then similar to that, like the cardigan sleeves are also going to be very popular. Let me know which trends are your favorites and if you want a part two."," These are my full 2021 trend predictions. Starting with sweater vest, which were a trend last fall. I know we all have at least one neutral colored sweater vest, but if you're looking to add more into your wardrobe this fall, up for sweater vest that have color in them, like this. Color is gonna be huge this fall. Next, I think brown leather jackets are gonna be huge. Like this, oversized ones. Also having a block leather jacket is also a must so just have both this fall. Next is cowboy boots. How we boots are gonna be the itch-oo, I think. Like this. And then I feel like again, color is gonna be huge so get them in a lot of colors. Next is anything and everything knit. Knit dresses, skirt, set, sweaters, everything. Some more ideas. Last but not least, crop blazer sets. It can be pants, skirts, shorts, shorts. Something like this. And I'm actually loving the silk one. And then peep the fuchsia color. That's gonna be in."," Summer trends tosser keep. White pants for summer is not groundbreaking, but it is incredibly chic. Definitely a keep. Something I never thought I would say. The Grammy-Berry jewelry is very in right now. I weirdly like this. It's a keep. We're seeing a lot of rooching right now. Now some people have really strong thoughts about rooching. I think it's incredibly flattering. It's a keep. Denom skirts are back, and I'm gonna have to set this one out. Like for the next part."," Spring trends, toss or keep, Alter tops are a keep for me, I love them. Oversized boyfriend shirts are a keep And draping your sweater over your shoulders is a key I love this trend. Custom Air Force ones are a toss for me. If you love them, that's great. Just not for me personally. Like for the next part.",,,,
,, Here are some of the Ike Girl fashion trends that will be in for the next few months. My name's Elle and I do trend forecasting. The first trend we're going to see is big wrap around sort of sunnies. I would say there's more futuristic style and less classic big gold glasses. And we'll be seeing them in a lot more colours as well. And we'll be fading away from the more cat eye sunglasses into these. I especially love the EC through lenses as well. The next trend we're going to see sets with pajama style sets like this. And then definitely going to be elevated through the styling like this one has a cool bag as well as the high heel boots. There's so many ways that you can really dress up a set like this too. And definitely the shoes make a really big difference. And the final trend is we're going to see this sort of deconstructed gathered skirts. These will both from the part of runway that will happen yesterday. They sort of big maximalist but minimalist tones sort of style. Even sort of styles like this as well., White after Labor Day is allowed this year because winter whites are the trend of winter 2024. During the day we'll see whites in suede shearing in knit fabrics. If you're into quiet luxury we'll be seeing more ivory satin fabrics like this and this. This will especially be a trend on the slopes and an evening wear. With evening wear we're gonna be seeing a lot of sheer sparkles with a white fur coat over it. A white fur coat is a must. They're so cozy but give a pop of elegance. This is how I did it on New Year's. This is currently my favorite white dress. It's from Nana Jacqueline and this Magda Bertram. I'm just quickly gonna show you guys a few more white pieces that I love. All of these are gonna be linked to my rodeo under edits. Those that are from Revolve will also be on my Revolve favorites. Dress from Helsa. This point on this sweater dress from Free People is incredible. I would wear it as pictured. I love this if you're planning a warm vacation anytime soon. Everything about this is just yes. It's off the shoulder dress and everyone needs a good white sweater. This is her. Let me know if you guys want a part two.," Bipel fashion trends to where this fall. Firstly, we have cherry red accessories. I think it's such a classy rich color that adds life to your outfit. You can pair it with beige, black, espresso brown, or even white. Look how well these two combine. The other color that is trending this season is espresso brown. And I'm so happy because I truly see it as a universal fall color. Matches both blondes and brunettes. It's very cozy yet elegant. You can also combine it with burgundy. Next, we have the opart print. This one is quite controversial. Some will say it's tacky. Some will say it's classy. I did not like this print before. And now I actually really like quality leopard accessories. Like for example sunglasses, bags, or heels. Apparently a part print with espresso brown or burgundy for an ultimate fall garlock. I also love that plaid is trending this season. And precisely plaid scarards and plaid blazers. The last trend is leather coats. Never been fan of leather coats simply because of how much either polyester or leather goes into these pieces. I think wool or Kashmir coats are much more ethical and environmentally friendly. Let me know in the comments which fall trend you like the most."," Here's how to build a capsule wardrobe with 2024's biggest trends. We've put together a list of versatile basics that we spotted on the runways that managed to build a capsule all of their own. The mid-hills shoe continues to strike the perfect balance between dressy and comfortable. Low-heeled ankle boots to parties season kitten hills are on our wish list right now. And what better shoes to invest in than the ones you can wear, time and time again. After toe-tem smash hit jackets single-handedly created a new coat genre. The scarf coat has returned year after year in new colors, lengths and fabrics. It does make sense though, as this ultra-sheak outerwear takes the fuss out of winter styling and combines everything you could possibly need to stay warm and chic in one easy item. The loose, straight leg denim style is right up our street. This roomier, more casual fit is perfect to pair with a chunky net and winter and with a tank top or tee in summer. We're still turning to cardigans over crew necks for warm layer that's easy to wear and also feels a bit more polished. Take tips from fellow stylish stars Alexa Chung, Sophia Richie Grange and Haley Bieber by wearing a fine knit with nothing underneath and pairing with jeans and the simple flats. Sorry mini skirts, we've made up our minds and there's much more longevity in the mid-h and the maxi than the microhem. Which other skirt dresses up and down is easily as a longer elegant slip or hemline. All you need is a change of shoes for two entirely different outfits and one and that makes the long skirt well worth its cost-poor. If there's one bag that is guaranteed to do it all, it's a roomy tote and we keep spotting minimalist styles on the arms of Instagram's best dress. Logo Mania had its moment and bold statement bags are great for bringing and look to life but if you're looking for an investment bag to spend a little more on for a lot more wear and understated toe will only go up in value. Back for another year, the tailored, wide leg trouser continues to be team who at where you gaze, favorite silhouette to flatter different shapes and sizes. So lebs and influencers are still wearing the poddle pants. If that feels like too much fabric, a kick flare cart will give you the same effect without overwhelming your frame. Just like the Medexi skirt, there's only one dress trend worth committing to this season and the longer the better. This winter, the knitted maxi dress comes into its own with a knee high boot for the office but is equally as chic with flat sandals and a boxy blazer come spring weekends. Let us know which of these pieces you absolutely love."," Make sure these spring pieces are in your closet to have a complete wardrobe for the spring. Light wash, slim straight gene that hits right above the ankle so if you're able to wear it with a flat, it's so important. I feel like we always get denim that we have to wear with heels. You need to have jeans that you can wear with flats. They're just more realistic and versatile. Silk maxi skirts are such an easy way to make your outfits go from day to night. Just swap out the shoe and you can easily have a versatile piece. A clean, crisp, crew neck white tea is a must for the spring. And because it's fun to try out trends, especially for a new season, I always recommend doing it with accessories so you don't have to revamp and buy a whole new wardrobe. So I always recommend buying a fun spring shoe. I personally love a ballet flat right now and I really love this red pop of color. Let me know if you guys want a part two with more spring must have pieces."," Here's some winter trends in pieces. I am so obsessed with this season and I am personally dying to try to incorporate into my own wardrobe. A lot of these just look so chic and cool girl to me and they will not leave my head. The first trend is gonna be book cut or flare cut jeans. I've actually deliberately gone and bought a new pair of jeans of this cut because I'm so obsessed with it. I have always liked a good book cut jean and I'm so happy that they're actually becoming trendy again. I think they're just the perfect jean for when you wanna wear boots or heels with your jeans. Whether it's more slim fit or a looser fit, I feel like they just make your legs look so good and long even though I love a good loose fit baggy jean. The more just slimmer book cut flare jean, they are just so flattering. And I think they look so much more polished and kind of cool girl to me. Another trend that we're seeing I am obsessed with is the fur coats. I'm not sure how long this trend will really last but for now I think it is so adorable. And I feel like with the fur coats, you can make it more street relaxed cool girl or it can just be so fun and chic and diva. Like actually who is this diva? I'm not even sure if this is really like fur but even this really like stringy fuzzy sort of texture on coats. It's just so fun. To me it's a really fun trend. Snow boots is another trend that I'm so obsessed with this year. I'm dying to get my hands on a good pair of snow boots. I'm not sure if I want to do the moon boot or pick a different brand. These are another one that I just think are so diva but still so chic and cool. And where I live we actually do get a good amount of snow. So I am determined to get my hands on a pair of snow boots. Going off of boots, I'm really obsessed with the new wave of skinny heels or kitten heels with boots being popular. To me a chunky heel, they're still fine and they are more practical but a skinny heel is just so much more elegant and elevated to me. I also think they just look more mature. Personally don't have a good pair of like knee high skinny heel boots but I will be getting some this year. Another one that I just think is so cute especially for winter are patterned sweaters and super Christmasy feeling ones like this or ones where the pattern is more focused around kind of the collar line. I just think they're adorable. And I think this year we are seeing them more in this trend that is more chic and classy while still having fun with your outfit."," Fall trends based on Matilda Drift's Instagram. These are with many as it's gonna be huge. You live somewhere where technically it's almost fall, but it's still a million degrees. This is a great outfit idea. We're also gonna see a lot of vintage leather jackets. Levit or hated bombers and bomber adjacent jackets are coming back. I've mentioned this a million times, but we're gonna see bigger bags. Love the vintage botegas. Maybe your nightmare, we're gonna see a lot of the denim skirt styled with boots. We're gonna see a lot of embellished and embroidered boots. Let me know who I should do next."," three trends that I'm seeing everywhere in New York City this summer. Number one, we have shorts for more menswear leaning styles and bubble skirts for more women's wear leaning styles. And when I say shorts, I'm not just talking about denim shorts. I'm talking about any style of shorts that have this more structured below the knee casual look to them. Number two, for footwear, there have been a ton of sneakers. The Adidas Samba is still incredibly popular. I'm also seeing a lot of new balance 1906Rs, but for women's wear specifically, I'm seeing a lot of high calf whether cowboy boots or rocky brown buckle boots everywhere. I also can't forget to mention the surge in loafers being worn, whether they're leather sole loafers, platform or everything in between. And number three, red. Red used as an accent on a scarf or as a top or being worn as a pop of color for a pair shoes. Number red still seems to be a lot of people's favorite color to bring attention and interest to an outfit. What did I get wrong? What did I miss? Let me know below.", And it goes like this," It's been about months since I've done my October Autumn wishlist, so let's look at my November wishlist. Starting off pretty strong and cheap, this £14.95, a new clothes bag. Everyone has it, but I just feel like it's such a staple in your wardrobe. I've actually ordered the orange one for myself and I've worn it with so many outfits. I really want to get the cream one next. Next to these necklaces, which I found on Pinterest, so if anyone has a small business or know of a brand that sells something like this, please let me know in the comments because I'm looking for one. I really like the organic form of the letters and I wear a lot of gold jewelry, but I do well like silver rings. I like to mix and match, so I'm really looking for one. Next is this Ganyverse. Gany do such nice vests, but I like this kind of classic colourway because I think it would be timeless and you could wear this every single autumn winter. I'm really liking the Colonyvy at the moment as well. I think it pairs really nicely with greys and creams. I don't know if I necessarily would suit a knitted vest jumper, but I see loads of people wear them and I think it looks really good on them, so I kind of want to give it a try. Next to these Cowboy boots from Office, they're £138, but they are real leather and I do think if you know that they're going to be a timeless piece in your wardrobe, you're going to keep forever, then I think it's worth investing in a real leather pair just because they'll last you way longer. The reason why I liked these in particular and why they stood out is because the hill is not too large, so I feel like you can get away with wearing them in the day. I personally would like to wear something like this to work and I walk quite a lot from the tube station and things like that, so I would need a boot that's comfy and I think these would be the perfect ones. So I know I've already purchased a orange bag, which is why I wouldn't immediately go for this colourway if I were to buy it, but if I wanted to elevate my wardrobe and buy something a little bit more premium, I'd definitely be looking at getting this bag. I think orange for autumn winter just goes so well with like a beige trench coat and even when you're wearing an all black fit."," four pieces that I think will be trending this fall as a fashion influencer. Of course, we all love the cargo pants, but I love the cargo skirt for fall. I think it's so perfect. I think it elevates any look, but still gives it a sort of street style vibe. Even layering looks so good with this piece. I love the way that she did a little jacket over it. It's definitely something I think we're going to be saying. Next up, we have loafers. I know we saw them during the summertime, but I just love them so much more during the fall. I mainly love them with skirts because I feel like sometimes when you're trying to style a skirt, you don't know what shoes to wear, especially if you don't want to wear heels. And I just love the way that loafers look, especially these shinnell ones. So cute and so classic. I know that we saw lots of crochet pieces during the summertime, because they're very breathable, but now that it's a little bit colder, we can bring out the big knits. This chunky knit makes such a statement. If this hat is so cute, it'll make your whole entire outfit. Even these little knit tops are so cute because you can put a blazer over them or something else to keep you warm, but they still give that element of a fall or winter vibe. Of course, everyone loves a trench coat we see at every year, especially in these neutral colors. Like this, I love this. But personally, as you can see, that's me. I love a bright color trench coat for fall. I think it gives a pop of color, especially because we're so used to neutrals during the fall time. I just love to add some color to my outfits. Even like this, we're keeping it neutral, but still making a statement. Let me know what other trends you guys want me to talk about."," These are 2022 summer trends that I have really been loving this summer. The whole Y2K summer glasses trend is really cute. The girlies have not been playing this summer with these sunglasses. Okay, these are my favorite ones. I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like this summer was definitely a trend to go to Europe. But people have been killing it with the fashion. This is really pretty too. It gives me very much Europe vibes. I love this braided hairstyle with the heart. And this is gorgeous. I have been loving this hair trend. Another Y2K trend that's been really cute is the baggy pants style. I feel like these pants really give a good accent to your waist. They really show your waist. My favorite look of this summer has been platform shoes. They long skirt and a matching tank top to go with. They were short. So cute. You guys have been wearing the shit out of these $600 headphones these summer. But go off.", Here are three transfers for spring that I've been loving. First is the mini skirt slash specifically this black skirt with a little slit. I think it's really cute. I didn't think I'd be into this but I think it looks so cute with like loafers or something. The next is just good old classic stripes. I can't remember the last time I wore stripes been a while but I did just buy a few sweaters I'm excited to wear. One of this one's so bad but it's sold out everywhere. And then specifically wearing the sweaters like tied around your blazer coat whenever I think it looks super cute. And then the last is cargo pants. They are literally everywhere right now. I just posted this one on Instagram. These are from Urban and I also just got this chocolate pair. But yeah let me know which out of these you guys are loving the most.," up guys and welcome to 30 days of winter outfits. I'm so excited to share a whole bunch of winter outfits. I'm in support with you guys. So this is outfit number one. I'm wearing this oversized boxy blazer from cotton on. You get this outfit, I had to get a large but I really do love it. The sweater base is from Sheen and the shirt dress is from Zafer. I think that layering in winter makes you look super cool, super stylish and then I've got my Zara boots on. Probably my favorite coaches are but the season so you're definitely going to see them in more outfits and then all of my jewelry is from Curator Jules which also probably won't change throughout the series but yeah that is outfit number one and I will see you tomorrow for outfit number two.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," You've got this summer styling hack and you already own the primary piece so it's super easy. Then just add these three trends to transform your closet staple. The first one is a 70s inspired bucket bag. I love something leather and classic like this grade. Then you're gonna wanna add a chunky gold piece of jewelry. I love a pinky ring. I love a chain. I'm sure you have something laying around that can add to this look. Last but not least, a pop of short truss. It is the color of the season. Botega has been doing it and it looks so fire."," This not that spring-20-am fashion skirt edition. But past couple years, everyone's been obsessed with the midi beige skirt, but instead of this, back to the 90s and wearing mini-mini skirts like Emma Chibbelin is wearing here. You can rock them with fun patterns like Ms. Haley Bieber here, or brypole colors like Rihanna's here, or pull off more of a business chic vibe like she is here. Would you rock this trend? Like a fall for more.",,,,
,,," 24 winter fashion trends you absolutely need to know about. Interesting textures is gonna be all the rage of the winter. So think along the lines of first, sequins, big knits, anything that's heavily textured, adds a lot of depth and dimension to any outfit, and just makes it a lot more visually interesting. For example, I love this 3D knit turtleneck from Chetlo, and this cardigan from the Attico, it's just too good. I'm obsessed with this sweater, and it also comes in brown. Even playing with shapes and textures like this top from Isamiaki, or even holographic knit tops like this one from Jean Paul Goethei. Who also can do textured accessories, I love this super fuzzy beanie from Nohles. Denim Bag from Jacques Mousse would really add that extra oomph to an outfit. And I love the texture and color of these tabbies, just too good. But of course, you don't have to spend a ton of money. There are some affordable options, like this dress from Zara and this top are a really great texture. They also have these faux first straight like pants, and I think are super cool. I try these on in store, and they're so soft. And I just have to include this textured coat from MSGM. I love how it's styled here, like this is perfect."," What's the cool girls will be wearing this fall? Plad is back this season. Granted, it's not really a radical idea for fall, but it is back in this interesting way. As seen here in this really cool dress, in with new colorways that aren't the typical red tartan, Plad skirts are really easy layering piece, and we'll see the stir over pants trend continuing this season as well. This fall, the girls will be wearing chocolate brown. This colorway has been seen all over the runway and is really complimentary to a lot of skin tones. While last fall, we were here for the red, this color has kind of evolved to this more burgundy color with the brown undertone. We're contributing to this chic, more neutral color palette. Ace symmetrical tops will be in, with interesting button details like this, and this, and these more sophisticated but comfortable necklines. As for jewelry, we're going back to mixed petals. While still for jewelry has been on the rise, now we're seeing this clash again, with fun bangles and stacks of jewelry that have this almost vintage antique feel."," But cool girls will be wearing for summer, 2024. Cool girls will be staying cool this summer with micro shorts. We saw a little bit of these in 2023. They're here to stay in 2024. I think we're gonna be seeing them actually even more. We'll see them in like a cargo pants style like this one. But I also think we're gonna be seeing micro shorts with more of a feminine edge. Kinda like this one with like the little ruffles at the bottom. Love them paired with a really nice casual look like this one with the tank top and then the bottom up. I think this is so, so cute. We're gonna be seeing a lot of white monochrome. You can mix and match your white and creams. I absolutely love this girly top with this little mini skirt. You also can never go wrong with a basic tee and white shorts. We'll especially be seeing a lot of matching white sets. I am absolutely obsessed with this outfit. It is so chic and elegant. One of my favorite ways to wear white monochrome is linen pants with a button up. Drop waist dresses so flattering, so elegant. Screens European summer to me. So even if you're not going to Europe, you can get the vibes going with a drop waist dress. Especially love it in a midi length. But also love a good mini dress paired with ballet flats. This is so cute. Tracker hats. These have gotten popular over the past few years. They are here to stay in summer 2024. If you like you, either love or hate these, but if you love them or can grow to love them, they're a really great summer accessory. Tracker hats take such a plain, basic summer outfit and really spices them up. It goes perfectly with your typical short tank top sneaker outfit for summer. And it's not only cute, but also practical. Keeps the center of your face."," Spring, 2024 fashion trends from a fashion stylist, part five. First up is fringe, but in new ways that we have not seen it before. There will be multi-length fringe with all different size beading, including more subtle and shorter versions paired with denim to make more casual. Not only seen on the bottom of hemlines, but also as accents flowing from unexpected places. Next up is a trend shown in almost every single spring 24 run-away show. If you weren't already able to guess from this photo, it's feathers. Shown sparsely like this to give texture and movement, as well as layered on more heavily to give lots of volume. Some feathers were more low-key, like this example, which makes them look almost like a pinned accessory."," This is what's gonna be trending this winter from a fashion stylist. Lofas were big last year and I definitely think they're gonna continue into this season. And on the topic of shoes, I feel like we're gonna see lots of new hybrids, especially like gumboot new hybrids. I'm actually obsessed with this trend and I think they are so cute. Now, the one that was around last season, I definitely think blazes will stay in trend this season as well. This is one I've already seen haves around Melbourne, but Maxi skirts, especially Denna Maxi skirts. They have already been big this year and I think the trend will definitely continue on into the colder seasons. I definitely feel like we're gonna see lots of blazes and hoody combos as well. I think this trend is so cute and a little way to kind of dress down your outfit without dressing it down, if that makes sense. This looks classy and chic. Honkiniets, I feel like are also gonna be huge this year. I think we'll definitely be seeing a lot of these. Let me know your favourite winter fashion trends in the comments and what you're excited to see this year from winter fashion."," Okay, June is officially over, which means we are now prepping for fall 2023 fashion. I'm gonna go through all the runway shows of this year and show you what you need to add to your closet and what you might already have and should definitely keep starting with the 80s Power Dress Taylored suits. This looks specifically is from the Saint Laurent show and we are seeing one thing across all of the blazers and all of the Power Dressing here, shoulder pads. This is Blanciago. Once again, we're seeing massive shoulder pads and we're also seeing very oversized Taylored suits. That is what we mean by the 80s suit, oversized shoulder pads. Otega Banana with their classic laid back, easy look. This is Slotchi. It's comfortable, but still shoulders. Slightly more understated, but still shoulders. Next up, this is a new trend that we have not seen in a pretty long time hourglass figure. We've been seeing a lot of oversized, a lot of baggy, a lot of like straight line silhouettes. We're now seeing hourglass on almost every runway and if you all remember the Peplum tops, they are officially back and that hourglass figure is so in here we have Miss Gigi Hadid walking for Versace in this gorgeous Taylored suit stunning. Okay, we have Richard Quinn also going for the hourglass here. Gorgeous, so flattering on every body shape. Balmon hopping on board as well also. This gorgeous top with the kind of ode to like seashell cups. Super in right now, we love. One more for Jason Wu on the hourglass figure because this red color specifically is also huge and we're gonna dive into that later. Okay, next up if you don't already know, Vivian Westwood passed away this year, moment of silence. Basically every single person that took through the runway paid tribute to her in some other way. Vivian Westwood was known for being very punk, very non-conformist, very feminine, but still pushing the boundaries of edgy and up first we have Mark Jacobs can see those massive platforms that feminine silhouette but still edgy punk killer style. Vivian Westwood was also known for her plaid patterns and the usage of that across almost all of our lines. You can see this jacket here and the pants they're total homage to Vivian Westwood. Think of like a chic London girl that looks really cool but you definitely are scared of her but you also wanna be her best friend. That is everything that Vivian Westwood was. We love the punk, incredible, gorgeous, beautiful. Okay, I'm running out of time so come back for more because there is so much more to talk about."," below you guys. So today we are going to chat about the trends that are coming up for summer 2023. I'm going to give you guys my opinions on the looks. Kind of what my thoughts are. Some of them are, hmm, some of them I really love. So let's get into it. Those of you who don't know me, my name is Megan. I own a boutique. It's an online boutique called M use and Maven. If you guys haven't checked it out, please do. It has the cutest styles for ladies and I know you guys will love it. All right, this first trend is kind of interesting. If you guys have been seen all of the little mermaid previews, then I'm sure like myself, my little five-year-old self is screening. This trend has to do with the mermaid-esque vibes. I know. Kind of crazy. So I can describe this trend is kind of think like netting. I would say form of the looks are kind of mermaid-esque vibes. As you guys can see, I've included some examples here. I'm kind of loving it. I do love this. I love the color scheme too. It's a lot of like neon's colorful kind of ocean-esque tones. So what do you guys think? I do love these examples that I included here. I think they're super chic for summer and we're loving the bright colors. This next one, I don't know how I feel about this, Bermuda shorts. I feel like I'm a little bit hesitant because I am a shortie. For us short girls, I feel like this inseam is not the greatest. I have included some examples that I do think are fun, chic, really classic. Now for you tall girls, I feel like you guys can pull this off so well. You are short. I would recommend that you wear some sort of a heel and some sort of a top tucked in. We are going to chat about this next trend. This is the fitted like fit and flare mini dress style. I couldn't really find any examples that I was like going gaga over. We've seen it like this style's been done. It kind of reminds me of like being in middle school a little bit. So I don't really know how I feel about it. I feel like for the right occasion, it is a feminine style that would look really cute. I don't know how I feel. I feel like it's been done. I feel like I'm coming over it. Back with the metallics. I feel like this trend just is not going away. I talked about this in my last spring trends video. Leave metallics were included in there as well, but this is specifically for metallic bags. I think it's cute. I think it's fun. Like if you wear a super monochromatic look with a bag or some sort of metallic bag, I do think it looks elevated. I think it's fun. So I can get behind this trend. I think if it gets too wild though, too sequiny, I don't think that's like summer. Personally, what do you guys think? The sound outside right now is just... it's killing me. Okay, lastly, the puff slides trend. I feel like I can get behind this because I'm a comfy gal. Okay, I mean, and I don't think any woman would turn down some sort of comfortable shoe. Okay, I am, I'm at that point in my life where I appreciate a good stiletto, but let's be real. We need some comfort on these dogs. Okay, some examples here. I think these are fun. These are cute. I would totally wear these with shorts. Wear them with sweats, like a sweatsuit vibe. I mean, there's so many ways that you could wear it. So I'm loving that the designer brands are putting out these styles, too, because then it's just like a win-win. You know what I mean? Guys, what do you guys think of these trends? Did you guys like this video? Let me know in the comments. I'd love to chat with you guys. And if you have any styling questions, please hit me up. I am always here to chat fashion. Love you guys."," Here's a trend that I think is going to be so popular this spring and going into summer. The tight fitted romper with the super oversized either trench or a blazer. This trend is 100% not for everybody. I do feel like the tall girls kind of have the upper hand on this one, but let me know in the comments. Do you think it looks cute or are you just going to pass on this or are you really excited to try it? Let me know."," Hey guys, I've been seeing a lot of spring and summer 2022 fashion trend predictions on my for you page and I just wanted to take a minute and give my predictions for nuclear winter 2022. Starting with the obvious, I do think gas masks are going to be really huge for nuclear winter. I think this black one is really really cool. It's really shiny kind of giving like a Julia Fox vibe. It's a little bit expensive at over $200, but you can find cheaper ones on Amazon. Next trend, I think we're going to see a lot of our warm puffer jackets just with the lack of sunlight getting to the earth's surface and I think we're going to want some fun bright colors like this just to stand out from the smoke and the sweat in the air. Last thing I think we're going to be seeing a lot of is just like fruit and vegetable prints on our clothes just with our crop supply being totally wiped out from the climate change. I think it's going to be reminiscent of a simpler time. We'll look for things like this. Let me know what you think."," fashion trends that are gonna be huge this year brought to you by the fashion gods. So I'm not making this up the fashion gods have spoken so what they say goes. You guys I'm just the messenger. One colossal massive huge coat and no I'm not kidding. Okay they're gonna look more like this but how cute though. Like seriously I want to roll out of my bed and my sweats and throw one of these massive coats on. Seriously. Punk futurism so if you and Goth or punk for the summer I want to see you super goth and punk for fall. All black leather, patent, dye your hair black, black fingernail, black thigh high boots that tie all the way up that are to put on but it's worth it. Lastly corsets we love corsets. We love them. Corsets corsets over shirts, corsets over dresses, corsets over coats. It's all about a corset. All about it.", summer 2022 fashion trends from you already know a fashion major and from the Lana part six. First up we have exposed underwear. I know this is not gonna be for everyone and that's okay. I feel like this is a current day version of the Whale Tales or exposed cheese drinks that we saw in the 2000s. I've definitely been seeing it more and more and I think the key is for it to be done in a very intentional way. I hope that makes sense. Like in a very effortless oh I just left my house and it really just happened wearing my boyfriend's underwear type thing you know you know but it is on purpose. I'm especially seeing this with sets like with a matching top or sports bra and I think a great way to wear it in the summer or if you're just not comfortable showing actual underwear is with a swimsuit with some jeans or shorts probably shorts for summer. Like this I think it's cute. We're also seeing a lot of boxers worn as shorts like this. I'm already seeing a lot of longer boxers or board shorts like this. Like for more.," You guys asked and you shall receive. Here is a spring trends report for shoes. First up, we have square-toed platforms. Okay, both of those very important, square-toed and platforms and fun colors. Again, like I said, platforms, square-toed, 90-slush, white-to-case style. Cow wayboots are not going away. I think the Lord I love cow wayboots, but we are seeing a trend where they have bolder colors, bolder patterns, mixed patterns, stuff like this. Bright boots. Literally, yes, I'm all for this. I have a similar pair already. I'm obsessed. Like, just bright boots guys. It is all about color this spring and summer. The talikes are so hot, especially silver. She's finally having her moment. She's finally front row center. Chair number one in the orchestra. Okay, so this is from Zara, I believe. I have a silver pair but those are really old from Asia. It's like on back in like November, so I can't link them, but you guys, silver heels, silver platforms, silver, square-toed, whatever, silver. Pink is also having its moment, but honestly, any just primary color, well, I guess it's not even primary color, but any primary color that is just like really vibrant and bright in the heel form. Yes. I'm seeing a lot more of this style, kind of just that like vintage you take on the sneaker. Bright whites are still in, but I feel like slightly off white slash a little bit of beige is kind of like the move now. These, I don't know if everyone's going to love what kind of like that dad sneaker, but the running sneaker version, kind of like the Axel Arigato version style. I don't know what these are from Mego, so I'm seeing a lot of these too. I'm still seeing a lot of clear heels so they're not going away, but when I say clear, not necessarily open-toed, but more of like the closed-toed situation.",," Here are three trends that are going to be popular this fall. Okay, the first trend, but I am so excited about cowboy boots. It's just so effortless and chic and just... Basically, wear them with anything you would wear a white sneaker with. Okay, the second one is so nostalgic for me, but Peter Pan callers. I'm aging myself, but I loved these 10 years ago and they're cute again. And the last one is probably obvious that plaid. But not just plaid blazers, plaid pants. Especially with a wide leg, so cute. Like for part two."," Summer trends toss her keep. Camouflage is back. She looks amazing, but I can't. It's a toss. We're gonna be seeing a lot of printed skirts. Definitely a keep. Hookah shells are back. And this is a toss for me. We're gonna be seeing a lot of black this summer. And I think it's really chic. It's a keep. Orange may be the color of the summer. And I love it. It's a keep. Like the next part."," 2021 was a year with giant ass pants and tiny ass crop tops. Where everyone dressed like an acid troop from a children's TV show. A time when people wore bags that looked like taxidermy to animals and wore prints that looked like your great grandmother's shower curtains. Heavy emphasis on the grandma fashions. I mean, seriously, people were dressing like they were on an Ivy League tennis team. It's into our giant clothes from the dumpster. I'm so glad we've made progress.",,,,
,," I predict fashion trends for a living and this is what you can expect to see in 2025. Except these aren't the micro trends that are going to be chuggy. These are like the trends that Sophia Richie and Haley Bieber will be participating in if you're catching my drift. Okay the first one is wearing very simple outfits with a statement belt. Belts are going to be the moment in 2025. It's definitely got to be the most coveted accessory as well as glasses. Like a classier old money school girl vibe. Okay second trend, hate to say it, the skinny jeans are coming back. They're coming back in full force with boots over the jeans. If you hate skinny jeans as which is I do you can opt for like a skinny leather pant or a skinny boot cut jean like this. I've been loving wearing these lately. The color of 2025 is going to be pistachio. Everyone's going to be wearing like pistachio shoes bags and sweaters like this color is just going to be everywhere. Another thing that's going to be really popular is belted jackets, even belted puffer coats. And to take it one step further, sink waist blazers are going to be everything for like a going out or a night time look. You could also belt your blazers for a more professional day time look, but expect to see a lot of cinch waist blazers and cinch waist jackets in general. Okay and that's it. That is the cool girl trends, not the micro trends that are going to pop off in 2025. Like this is literally the presentation that I'm going to give at my job of trend forecasting. So I'm giving you guys the insider information. Bye."," morning we're going to recreate this look for the office today. Fazda cup of tea. This outfit looks so put together but it's basically just using all of your basics so I have my white t-shirt, my v-neck jumper and my baggy jeans. This is my favourite t-shirt it's from Uniclo. My favourite jeans. Actually it's not my favourite jeans but they work. This is my favourite belt it's from Lily Silk. I love that gold detail. My new favourite jumper. Next jewelry gold bracelet. Wild necklace. I love a stacked necklace over a v-neck jumper with a white t-shirt but I actually only have one gold necklace so watch. So chunky hoops. Tear the coat. Fast fluffy socks. It's cold out there. This is the coat. Giving the structure shoulders smart feel. We love this coat. I just think the layering looks so good. When I'm in the office it's always the loafers. We have some accessories to keep us warm. The striped grey scarf or I have to try this on. Put up. Sunny's on. Morty. Or the striped scarf. I'm leaning towards the striped scarf for the office. Sunny is because it's actually going to be nice and sunny today. Morty. I patched my work bag. It's always going to be this bag for me but I actually have a new black work bag arriving which I think will be probably better for this outfit but for now this is the look. I'll shut theeline Bye"," of the top fashion trends for winter 2024. Eight for coat is absolutely dominating the high fashion scene right now. For nighttime I like to pair up with a cheetah dress like this or with some sparkle. It's so cozy but chic. The day I love this monochromatic look. They'll love it with jeans, especially gonna be seeing white fur hats like this. We're kissing the boxy blazer goodbye. You're letting our hips out. I've always loved the more tailored love pairing every top cinched. That's it. We're gonna be seeing a lot of rounded arm to enhance the cinch waist illusion and be seeing ginormous sleeves. The coolest runway show every sleeve was like this. We also achieved this look by throwing on a really boxy cropped blazer. Our top that's super cinched like this. Buckles make it tighter. Then lastly, we all know that cheetah's in. Specifically the red and cheetah combo are going to run the winter. Pointed toe cheetah shoes are iconic and we're also gonna start seeing cheetah pants soon. Bye."," We'll see more of this here. The oversized blazer shorts combo is back, but less like this and more like this. Just looks so good with boxer shorts. This is kind of niche, but we're gonna be seeing a lot of halters with collars like this and like this, drop waist dresses are definitely coming back. And this is like the cutest trend. We'll see this a lot paired with a bubbleham. This will definitely sell out and not to trigger my millennial followers, but we will start to see business casual for a day.", Let's talk about what's trending for spring 2024. Here we have fun pants. Feel like in years past we would do like a very fun top with very simple pants But now we're actually moving into the reverse so some fun pants with a very simple top. Leopard is the absolute moment right now These pants are so hot. I know Gani has some but I'll try and link some cheaper options for you guys I love these little lime green stripe moment with like a super simple white tank and sambas I think we'll see outfits like this all summer long with like a bikini and a super fun pattern pants. I love these Another super cute pant with a simple top. I think these gold and silver foil pants definitely fall into this trend And I'm here for it. This is more of a chill pattern if you don't want to go too loud If fun pants are not your thing you can also go with a really fun maxi skirt with a more simple top or something like this I absolutely love this little leopard skirt But you can go with a fun mini skirt and a very simple white t-shirt Let me know what you guys think about this trend," Let's talk 2023, 2024 winter fashion trends that you might wanna know about. We've seen the runways, we've seen the fall fashion, so now let's see what the winter trends are gonna be. Winter trends can be so easily overshadowed by fall trends, but winter trends are so exciting, because essentially we take what works and fall, but it becomes really, really popular, and then we push it into winter, and we add all the fun winter styles that we normally have when we combine the two. So let's see what's in this year. All right, I set up my fall trends video, and that went absolutely viral, but red is the color of the season. We know that we've heard it a thousand times, but it's definitely staying for winter. You can expect it in more of the deeper reds, and also the cherry reds still, but it's for sure gonna be a trend. We've seen it stabilized, but like I mentioned in that video, and I feel like the whole fashion world is kinda talking about, is it will be more jackets, purses, handbags, shoes, same thing, you know what I mean? More of the accessory realm. Something a little more unique that I'm seeing is these big fluffy fur coats and jackets, whether it's in the detailing or all around fluffy furry jackets and coats. We're seeing them everywhere, and they are so cute. I think they're really fun, and they take a normal outfit and make it so exciting, instead of our normal basic, praying thing. So this is fun, so fashion, we love it. It's another way to wear it, and we love a full, big, fluffy furry jacket, but I think something like this is also a little more practical, where it's just a little more detailing, and it's a little bit of an easier way to move into that trend. It's really fun. Biker boots are officially here to stay, and they're becoming more and more accessible, and more and more wearable in the styles that we're seeing that are being put out, so this is very exciting. And we're seeing more versions of biker boots like this, where it's a little more clean, a little more chic, a little more easier to style, if you're not comfortable with all the buckles. So this is a great option if you wanna try them out. Honorable Bench and Off the Shroller tops are absolutely in, and they're staying for sure. We're seeing all these different styles, we can put out by so many different companies, which is very exciting. It's very chic, it's very, very winter. I really like this. Something absolutely huge that we have to talk about, it's just increasing its way into fashion as a trend for quite some time now, but the sheerling and Sherpa detailing, the sheerling and Sherpa codes, they're absolutely huge in setting this year, to the point where it's being integrated in so many different things like handbags, and shoes, they're all having these little sheerling Sherpa details. I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone buy this bag recently. These Chloe boots, I've seen so many girls wearing them, or different versions of them. They are so cute, I really like this. I think it adds a fun variety. Go part two for more."," Part three of Ways to Wear Fall 2023 runway fashion trends in your everyday life. So, Part three of the Fall 2023 runway recap discusses cherry red and midi hams and a lot of you had things to say about feeling like those two things are not flattering on you either because of skin tone or body type but I'm gonna tell you ways that I think you can do these trends and make it very flattering to yourself personally. Let's start with the cherry red trend. So, a lot of you probably already know of the term the trickle down effect where we see runway trends from designers and then we see this trickle down into more accessible designers and they create their own adaptation of that trend. So, for example, with cherry red, what this really means for us in Fall 2023 is just red. Here is an example of a super cute outfit with a hint of red just as an accent in these adorable cowboy boots. It's not the whole red. It maybe isn't like the top and you don't like the way it flushes out your face. It's not that it's just in the shoe. It's not even cherry red but it's a red and it's gonna be great in fall. It's another example of red as an accent color. Once again, we have it in the shoes down there. We also have the bright red lip and I really like that because it shows that the color is gonna stick around not just in fashion but also in beauty too and it can kind of transcend that way. Here's an example of red as more of a statement piece in a garment that you're wearing. So, this is on top shop right now. Actually, it's really cute red semi-lather, semi-sweave jacket. Adorable. This will be perfect for fall. Okay, I don't know how to make this picture zoom out but here's another example of cherry red as a top. Topped into the oversized trousers and that is giving the Hourglass figure. Go back to my last video to learn more about the Hourglass figure and why that's so in. Next up is the Midiheim. So, Midi is anything that falls between the knee and the ankle length. Classic Midi is right halfway between the knee and the ankle but it really encapsulates anything. So, yes, T-length is also included in this and we're seeing a lot of that as well but I got a lot of comments that the short girls feel that they can't wear Midi and I would respectfully disagree. I'm a short girl myself and I think the best way to wear Midi if you're shorter is with a pair of just nice little kitten heels and it boosts you up, gives you that extra height and the great posture. These denim skirts are not new to anyone I'm sure because we've been seeing these all over but just another example of a midi skirt. You can see it has that big slit in there so it might not make you feel quite as short. This is paired with some boots I am obsessed right now with the midi skirt and tall boots. Incredible glamour. One more example of the midi skirt with some really cute little ankle socks and flat so it doesn't always have to be a pair of heels. Okay, that's all for now but come back for more soon. Bye!"," Summer 2023 trends, let's talk about them. First, denim on denim. It's in, it's hot, and the 90s girl and me is really excited about this one. Next, we're gonna be seeing a lot of corsets. I think corsets come around every summer. They're feminine, they're sexy, and I love them. Cargos are probably the hottest they've ever been. We've seen Fendi, Jibanshi, and Versace all having this. Here's another example. Cull ball glue and pink will be everywhere. We're also gonna be seeing a lot of pieces with asymmetric details. Remember, you don't need to buy trendy pieces to stay looking modern, and that's a myth. Just buy what you truly love. I'll see you guys in my next video."," in summer trends that are worth the investment. Brought to you by a former luxury buyer of 10 years, starting off strong, the color red. I think we all could be in agreement that the Valentino pink is on its way out. And red's the new pink. That is a timeless color. And everyone's talking about quiet luxury. And let's say red is a symbol of opulence. But more importantly, this dress by Zara is so chic. And why is it worth the investment? Because you can wear this color season after season. Next up, Mary James. I was a little bit on the fence of whether or not to add this to the running. Then I saw these shoes. I'm more wearable Valentino. But we all know the massive platform that we all love. But let's be honest, I can only wear mine for like 20 minutes. And with the introduction of this new Mary Jane silhouette, we're gonna see more of this silhouette making an impact in street style. And I know I keep talking designer, but let's discuss this pair from Reformation. And another reason why the styles worth the investment. It's closed toe. Meaning you can wear the Mary Jane into fall and winter with a cute pair of tights. The incognito handbag. And I wouldn't even call this a trend because it lends itself to quiet luxury. Quiet luxury consumer. They don't even need to flaunt their well. But back to the handbags. The reason why the incognito bag is so timeless is because I can pass this bag down to my granddaughter. And even logo heavy brands are doing it their way. Like this YSL, you can barely see the logo. But it is incognito. Next up is a cinched waist blazer. I love this trend because let's be honest, I'm over the boxy blazer. I am. Like this silhouette is so fresh. I love it. It creates such a seamless silhouette for tailoring and we are going to see this through fall and winter. Trust me. Next up, 90s minimalism. Like the Rachel Green in me is screaming. And I notice that there is a little bit of synergy with the minimalism, the incognito bag and even the red. It's all classic. And you can never put a timeline on classic. But again, classic elegance never goes out of style. So what do you think? Do you agree with these trends?"," I'm shopping with me. I'm a trend forecaster and part of my job is analyzing how retailers are translating the season's trends. Today, I'm checking out H&M's winter assortment. Something I'm loving right now is this movement towards day shine. So basically, that's elevating simple everyday pieces, but styling or adding little details to them in a way that just makes it so much more fun and interesting. I feel like everyone is on a racing kick right now, so I thought it was cool they integrated that into their graphics. And then with other sports too, just super, super cute iterations. Plus, they also introduced the ultra-trendy psychedelic prints that are having a moment right now. Quilting was another trend that they really dove into, and I think it's a lot of fun. It's really a nice way to mix up outerwear. Lastly, you are going to want to get yourself one of these layering turtlenecks I am seeing them everywhere right now.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," Don't buy that trendy halter top. Instead, thrift like a dollar vintage scarf, super cute patterns, colors, etc. And tie it around. Let me show you. So it does work best with a long rectangular scarf like this. But your gonna do is you're gonna start with it in the middle of your back like this. Cross them over and then tie it into a halter behind your neck. After that, you're just gonna, you know, kind of adjust it until you like how it looks. I like to even tuck it into what I'm wearing. Just kind of get it how you like it. And then I like to wear it with either like a swamp tube top or a vandal or even a swimsuit top."," Alright, since you guys like the first one and in honor of the first thing is brain, I'm going to be again testing my closet to see if I have the nine trends that I should have in my closet according to pure why. And again, I'll be using my various myopic method. Zero to three, not ready. Four to six, kind of ready. Seven and nine, ready, ready? All right guys, let's go. Alright, so first of all, this is shades of yellow. And I've got that with this very light yellow linen blazer. Off to a good start. This is a plaid skirt suit and I take that good start back because I don't know this. Next sequence in sparkle. And she's reading herself with this vintage beaded singlance in sparkle cake. Oh, wow. Up next is corset detailing. And not me having a leather corset in my closet prepared for this exact moment. Next is more white to Caleb. And they define that as like a double denim look. Like Britney Spears just in timber lake, the MTV Music Awards era or Destiny Shop. And I am the moment ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a double denim look. More cut out dresses. I don't have it. When I go talk about it, move on. Bold color combinations. Can you get more bolder than this color combination that I wore? Check the date. Check the date. 82621. And this article was put out in November. I was ahead of the game. Up next are many skirts and that is another note for me. And last but not least, French. And if you were thinking I didn't have it, you'd be wrong because I do. Because I do. So in conclusion, I'm kind of ready for fashion this spring. And I hope that this encourages you to go into your closet and not into somebody's store to get trends that you want to try this spring season.",," I didn't know this would turn out so far, we fell too close.. RUCE"," Hot and trending fashion, summer 2021. So we talked about baggy jeans a lot. Let's talk about the bright colored boxy blazers really coming in strong for summer 2021. Boxy oversized and bright. Neon also coming in really strong, but I think this is fleeting. I don't think it'll last past the summer. Wrap around, absolutely love this trend carrying over from spring in dresses, tops, even wrap around blazers. And this brings me to my next two points, which is cropped blazers and cutouts, cutouts in jeans, cutouts in tops. We've seen cutouts on the runway for the last few seasons in the form of skin tight dresses, leggings, tops, pants, and jeans. I'd say the cropped wrap around blazer is my favorite trending piece of the season."," My favorites spring 2021 trends. Pastels, pastels and more pastels. Poopy shoulders. Fun necklines to spice up Zoom call. Powerful and pattern button ups.",,,,
,," 2025 fashion trends part two. This year we're gonna be mixing a lot of sporty pieces into our outfits. We'll be seeing it in the form of rugby tops, chalk pants, varsity jackets and windbreakers, and of course adding a cool sneaker. I've always thought that mixing in a little bit is something sporty into an outfit, instantly makes it look cooler, so I'm here for this trend. I also think that we're gonna start seeing these sporty Mary Jane's pop up. Bag terms is nothing new, but it's evolving in 2025. The number of charms we're putting on our bags is multiplying. They're even taking over the runways, and I think a lot more people are gonna be getting these little jelly cat cute chains. I thought 2024 was gonna be the year of adding a bunch of charms to our shoelaces, but I think I was a little bit early. I think 2025 is gonna be the year that charms make their way to shoes, and even to our hair. There's also gonna be a lot of Western influences here. Again, with the statement studded belts, cow hide print, French coats, fringe bags, lots of dark denim, specifically, and riding boots. And what kind of jeans go with riding boots, skinny, straight leg and boot cut jeans? We'll be writing them tucked into our riding boots like this and style like this. Let me know what you thought about these trends."," these three trends are out for this winter, and here's what to wear instead. Don't forget to save this for when you do your winter shopping. The first one is more of just a shift from fall to winter, so we're not really seeing the quarter or any more like the jacket instead. Sherpa Sheerling, that is all here to stay. Something like this jacket here. This Amazon pullover was rated one of the best pullovers for this winter, or this cozy Sherpa jacket from Advocrombee. Second trend that we're not really seeing for winter 2024 are the oversized dresses. Oversizes still here to stay in many things, but not so much with the dresses instead. On the winter 2024 runways, there was a big nod to the 50s with the fitted waist like this, the skirt suit like this. Here's how we're wearing them for this winter. This designer fitted waist one is over $2,000, but I found a really good alternative. This one from Amazon, you can see it has the fitted waist, and I think it looks pretty similar. Like this, or even like this. For the skirt suits, I'm loving this one from Amazon, and this one from J-Crew Factory. Next trend that's been really big for the last couple of years, but we're not seeing it in winter 2024 is tie dye. Instead, black and white outfits and accessories were seen all over the runways. Something like this, I have this one and love it, like this. And here's like these, my friend has these, and they look super cute in person, or even these."," All the trends you need to know from New York Fashion Week. If you've seen my previous videos, you would know that mobile fashion is in. We're seeing lots of oversized fur coats, black silhouettes, the more black the butter, the leopard print is everywhere, and the bigger the fur the butter. We've also been seeing lots of sheer dresses like this. Michael Caws is absolutely killing it this fashion week. And he has one more sheer dress from their collection. God forbid the no-pound look and let's not forget this amazing sheer look. The golden look was in, and so are fringe dresses. I'm loving this golden-bellish skirt. If there's anything we've learned from Fashion Week as you can't overdo the gold. We also saw lots of hues of grey as mentioned in my previous video, grey is your latest wardrobe staple, and the tailored look is so in right now. Of course, cherry red is not going anywhere any time soon, and we've been seeing it for some time now. There were pops of cherry red everywhere. I particularly love the leather jacket. Oversized clothing and accessories seems to be very in right now. We're seeing lots of oversized sweaters, and don't forget the oversized bags, and must have wardrobe accessory. Finally, girl core hasn't gone anywhere. We're still seeing floral accents and clothing like this and this. Perhaps the most controversial would have to be the sheer look. Tell me what are your thoughts on this? Would you be gay enough to wear it? What are your favourite trends from York Fashion Week? Hit the save button for future alpha info, and thanks for watching."," 2024 fashion trends, what you can try and what you can leave behind. Capri pants will be making a comeback, but I'm going to have to leave this one behind and save it for these supermodels, their toddlers, and the elderly. Pepplem tops will be having a moment once again, but I'm going to fence with this one because sometimes they make you look a little bit wider than what you are. Now they are still trying to force the socks with heels, socks with sandals, but I'm going to have to decline. I mean, it's given toddlers into eras, it's given whatever happened to baby Jane. Look it up. Now, Pello shirts would be trending all of 2024, but this is a timeless piece. This is a classic. I mean, if you know, you know, the minis are out and the oversized slouchy bags are in and I am here for it. Thank BoTeGA, thank Hobo. Where do you excited to try and what will you be leaving behind? Let me know in the comment. I hope this helps. Bye bye."," the cool girls will be wearing this spring. The real cool girls not gonna get rid of her Adidas shoes just because it was trending last year. So definitely be seeing Adidas shoes this spring but in some fun colors like this red definitely this blue ones. But if you're sick of Adidas and you're looking for a cool color fo shoe, Syah brand has some really cool ones. Look at this cobalt blue. So pretty. Another cool girl essential for spring are the ballerina flag. I absolutely love these trapey ones. That ones are also super cute but the right ones are my favorite. These ones are Loha. You can also find some really cute ballerina flag on Dolce Vita. You know I love red ballerinas. Another cool girl essential is a kitten heel. Dolce Vita has the cutest ones also this one and also some winetose linkbacks. Perfect if you don't want to wear heels. I absolutely love winetose shoes these ones are from Vagabond. Again with the red ones red is definitely going to be trending this spring."," Not to look stylish in the mountains. Apparently lots of you don't like a jumpsuit. That's why we're going for leggings. A turtleneck to keep us warm. This is always such a hard decision. I never know if I should go for the long one or the short one. I decided to go for the long boot. I'm doing silver earrings. I'm not sure if it's too much with a hat, but let's see. Option one, an option number two. I also need gloves and these new sunnies. And that's the final box."," Part four of Fall 2023 trends you need in your closet. I'm gonna go through new trends that are popping up that you definitely need. And old trends that are not going anywhere and are definitely sticking around, starting with the art collector. I think there are a million different names that we could use for this style of fashion that we're seeing right now. But the long short is art novelty pieces on the garment itself. For example, right here we have Jill Sandor rockin' the cherries. If you know from Jacques Mew's, cherries are big this year. We have a digital screen art printed on this top. Another example from Lonvin' Art on the garment itself. We're just calling this category the art collector. Give me an alien fairy princess and I'm absolutely here from it. From Darte with the Fall 2023 art collection piece here. I love it. And next up I'm gonna call this category Feathery and Fluffy because we're seeing feathers across almost every runway show. We're also just seeing a lot of fluff, whatever it is, fluffs. But here we have Burberry Fall 2023, feathers red color that we've been seeing everywhere, gorgeous. Salvador Ferragamo with the fluffy and the cherry red, gorge. Low with the straight up bird look here. Feathers in 2023 are happening. I'm so here for it. One more from Boatigah Banana because is it feathers? Is it fluff? I don't know but we like it a lot. It's fun, it's frilly, it's playful, it's gorgeous. Last but not least, Dolce Gabbana with the feathers here because it's giving Gothic and that's everything we're seeing in Fall 2023. This feather Gothic look will dive into that in a second. Next up I'm gonna call this Mermaid Corps because it is an ode to the sea shells draping like a mermaid. We love. So here we have a low fall 2023 draping. We have that sea color. We have the little shell up there. Adorable ocean princess. Boatigah Banana with the ode to little sand dollars on there. It looks like you actually just plucked and put little sea shells all over her top. It's adorable. We have the blue turquoise earrings on that as well. Turquoise has been all over as well. We love this. This is a little bit more subtle but Rick Owens Fall 2023 giving mermaid core. We have the draping, we have the metallic shinies like a mermaid. It also the way that the metallic sequins are sat looks like little scales on a mermaid. Gorgeous. So fun. I want more for Balmon because these little cups right there look like sea shell cups again in ode to sea shells, ocean mermaid core obsessed with all of this. Okay, come back for more. We have so much to talk about specifically this new kind of preppy and how we're gonna do at this Fall 2023."," So let's talk about fashion trends for this summer. I have five trends that you can find in any thrift store, no matter what city you live in, no matter what state you live in. So the first trend for this summer is denim on denim. You've seen me wear denim on denim a few times now. You can find any type of denim in the thrift store. You can find of course jeans, you can find denim button up shirts, you can find denim dresses, denim skirts, denim shorts, denim caps. You can find any type of denim in the thrift store. So check out each section, even if you have to do some DIY to your denim. And remember you can mix and match shades of denim. That makes it even more interesting. So denim on denim number one. The second trend is what I'm wearing, metallics. So metallics is huge this summer and it's probably going to carry until fall and winter because of the holidays and things like that. But the idea is to dress down your metallics and wear them for a day. I would dress down metallics by adding a casual element to your outfit. The third trend is bubble hams. So bubble hams were really popular in the early 2000s. And now they're coming back. So you can find bubble hams in like shorts and dresses and skirts. Number four is drop waist. So the drop waist trend is coming in and dresses, skirts. Even shorts like drop waist is pretty much just elongating your torso and just slaring out like a skirt arch. The last trend I want to talk about is sheer. So sheer carries over into different categories. So you have sheer dressing. You have the ballerina core element of sheer. You have sheer in like corset tops, things like that. So just sheer dressing. And also the sheer can be different colors. It could be black to tap into another trend that I'm just going to mention. I guess as an honorable mention, the grunge trend. If you want to tap into that grunge element, you can wear sheer black, like a sheer black dress, sheer black top, things like that. Leave in the comments what other trends that I missed that I did and mentioned that you're partaking in this summer. Have a good day."," Welcome to part three of the spring summer trends that you need to know brought to you by Vogue. Starting with surface value. Now I'm not just talking sequence. Other textures such as ruffles, feathers, pom-poms, how amazing is this dress from and other stories. Mwah. Items that are engineered to be playful and create a statement. Trend 2, fight club. That's a really love these trend names that they come up with. Anyway, I really love this trend and it lends itself to festival season. This is how I really see this trend playing out. This is from free people and I love how they layer this body chain bra. It's very wearable and adds a little punk to a very classic glam dress. And I really also love how they styled it over classic YT. I mean, this is great. Final trend, the goddess. This draping effect really lends itself to old Hollywood. It's after Liz, it's romantic and I love this sheer dress from Farragamo. And that's the wrap of my three-part series. Definitely let me know if you want more trends."," I was just rambling about my visions for fall and winter, but I'm gonna put up some screenshots of examples and some things that I ordered. So I just ordered these Jeffrey Campbell meal platforms. The other called it a platform loaf. Super cool. I love Jeffrey Campbell. I like, I have been so loyal to him for years. But also there's more colors. We're having an 80s winner. Like I've decided that's what we're having. And, hmm. Imagine this with like a white outfit, maybe like a little white suit since we're being business casual and not like white white, like off white. Here's another pair. These are just so cool to me. I absolutely love them. Just so different than anything else. And I'm really tired of everyone being in sneakers all the time. I feel like we should spice it up. I just ordered these Sam's. I'm really glad that they're all one color and don't have black souls. I know that Brown's really popular now and it's definitely like come back. But this, this is gonna be good. This is gonna be a good winner for Brown. So sort of Y2K but like 80s because the thick soul. I just ordered these and I'm so excited about that. I think that they're more of a shoe than a slipper so I think that these are just even more acceptable to wear outside. Even though it really doesn't matter what you wear outside. You can wear anything. But you could put a fit with this. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm talking about. Okay. I also just got this jacket. I think the long trench thing is gonna be way cool. I still like a trench coat rain jacket in the store the other day. It was so cute. I know we've kind of neglected the down vest things, you know, in middle school and high school wearing them. But I think that they're gonna be really cool. I think that it's gonna be great layering pieces with sweaters and like, you know, business casual 80s. It's what I've been talking about."," Let's talk about a fall trend and I think this one might be a little bit controversial. And how would be denim maxi skirts? Even Matilda Jurf has worn one, so let's get into how you can style it. I think the structured feel of denim is perfect for pairing with the soft sweater and suede boots. You could also go for a silky top and a soft other bag like this. And honestly I really like this look with the black body suit for a night out. I love the color blocking effect of this bright white skirt with the black top and jacket. And if you're going to go oversized just keep in mind proportions like belting in your waist. I love the proper top mixed with the denim."," Pounding patterns in summer 2022 fashion from a fashion major. First up we have lots of stripes like this For this any stripe, but what I'm seeing a lot of is pin stripes like this this or this and this one's definitely gonna be following us in To fall. I love it. Next up we have very abstract watercolor-esque patterns like the infamous Kindle dress Like I said just very watercolor-esque abstract like this this or this I feel like this also ties in a very updated version of the tie-dye pattern kind of getting quarantine PTSD But I love it. Next up we have the newspaper print. We saw this one a lot coming in spring And I think it's gonna transition to fall very well. It's so cute I feel like I've already said abstract so many times, but just abstract patterns in general Like this or this and if you watch a lot of my videos you know my favorite the postcard print It has a very vacation-y vintage feel. I love it. Comment what you want me to do now CF D' Cro plataforma biscuits"," Easy trends to hop on for Spring and Summer 2022 from a fashion major. Part two. First up, we have corset tops. I really think they're such a great staple this season and they can be worn so many ways, and they're just so cute. We're starting to see them more like this with less boostier or underwire detailing, which I think just makes them more versatile, but I still like them both ways. Next up, I feel like I've been talking about this so much, but it is please say. It can be incorporated into any piece, but we're definitely seeing a lot of the please say sets like this, I think it's great for a cute but casual look. We're also seeing lots of please say tops like this, and really just in a lot of, but oh, a bird. A bird just flew in my window. It's okay, that don't worry. Anyways, we're seeing them especially in a lot of button-down shirts and dresses like this. Going with please say we're just seeing a lot of texture in general, especially the crinkle material like this, and texture like this. Like for part three.",," Let's talk about timeless pieces for your fall wardrobe. First of all, hats, hats of just all sorts. A beret in specifics is a classic fall timeless piece, but isn't something that's like super crazy trendy either. I have this one, I have this red one. Here's a really pretty cream one. Then hats like this, this was actually my grandma's and there's like so many really fun super vintage looking hats that honestly I would hit up antique stores for that are really pretty and wearable like this one, but also super vintage and will never grab a style. Well vintage slip dress for the fall. Yeah, slip dresses are just timeless. You can find them really easily at a goodwill. And in the fall you can wear them with like really fun jackets. You can layer them with turtleneck, super cute. Loafers galore. In addition to like a cute heel boot like this, I think a good thrifted comfy boot like this that doesn't have too much heel is awesome. And lastly, I want you to run to a thrift store and thrift a bunch of vintage buttons because they can be layered so many."," I'm gonna share three fashion words you should know this summer. Cowell next. See this, this is the cow part. Cowell, not cow, not cow part. Paper bag waste. Honestly, it's so much more flattering than it sounds. Flat form. Now you can say flat form or flat form sandals, whatever. I'm not sure they're really my style, but I can appreciate them."," spraying trends, toss or keep.

You cannot tell me an outfit like this is not perfect for spring and summer Even though this is not technically a color. I want to talk about bold patterns and pattern mixing I feel like we are a little bit tired of the minimal aesthetic and we are moving towards a maximalist aesthetic and for this spring We are gonna see it in bold pattern pattern mixing a ton of stripes We are gonna see stripes everywhere in any color and width of course a ton of stripe polos and overall a ton of bold and fun patterns"," 2024 fashion trends from a fashion major. First up in one of the biggest leopard print dresses, pants, coats everywhere. I'm especially seeing it a lot mixed with red, which is still an absolute, it color this year. I'll love it. I feel like I physically cannot make this video without talking about the mob-boy aesthetic. However, I feel like it needs its own video. I got a lot to say. Really the main part of it that was gonna be its own thing regardless of the mob-boy, fur coats. We've seen more fur trim coats the past couple years, but we've been moving a lot more towards these all over fur coats. Next up, I've been seeing a lot of very dramatic cinched in wastes like this. Why'd I do that? Or like this. Which kind of leads us to our last one, peplum. And not the 2012 peplum, like this. I love it, like for part two."," Raise your hand if you have a closet full of clothes, but still nothing to wear. Let's fix that. Here's some outfit ideas for the fall. I've been waiting patiently all year for Mother Nature to drop the temperature a little bit more so I can wear a sweater and a skirt. There's just no better season for fashion. Touch me in a floor length fur coat, and of course I will not be stepping foot out of my house unless my sunglasses match my bag like this. I'm just out of the bracelet on top of the shirt. We're really throwing everybody off with this one. Don't neglect the staples. It's not basic. It's very put together and you'll look great. I'm like, does she have a like to know it? Where the hell is this chunch from I need to know? I love the balloon leg cut on these pants. Definitely a heel with this."," And in 24 cheap fashion trends that are gonna make you look expensive. Bribes. Either something like this, like this, or like this. For some reason, it does make you look clean and polished. My favorite touch, a cardie on top of your outfit, on top of your dress, like this, like this. Extra points, if you match it with any part of your outfit, either your bag or your shoes. The extra touch to have that glam look, without too much effort. Another thing that you can do to look expensive, for me, my opinion, it's either a messy hairstyle like this one or this one or a tight, low bun like this one. So they're having a messy hairstyle and they're not fit put together. It's something very controversial. Ever, it still makes you look like a hundred million bucks. Another cheap trend that will make you look rich is mixed cholouries, golden silver, like these, these. Or in this case, she's wearing a pearl necklace with gold cholouries. Again, I know they might be controversial for you, but I still think that looks sophisticated. Thank you for listening and follow for more."," Spring, 2024 fashion trends from a fashion stylist, part two. Florals for spring, we got it. 2024 though specifically roses. Not just in print but also 3D form on dresses on shoes. Some dresses even entirely resembled a rose petal. And roses were not only seen in red but also in white using materials like crocheting. Next up is cutouts but not the standard ones. The cutouts in 2024 are less rounded and more angular and was like slashes. Also shown in ways as if the item is something undone. Another example but more subtle by the pockets."," 2020, 2020, 24 fashion trends that you might want to know about. The last few videos I talked about all the different things that we've seen from fall roll into winter. Let's get into it. First things first, I want to talk about the themes that we're seeing this year. A big theme that I'm seeing for winter, 2020, 2020, 24 is cozy, chic, and ski chic. Hear me out. Cozy chic. You know, that's a shirling and Sherpa trend. That's a huge this winter. I talked about it in the last video on Gossia. This is a perfect example of cozy chic that I'm seeing really, really happen way more than we've ever seen before. Oh, look at her outfit. She's got the Sherpa. Nice cozy, kibble knit pants, kind of shoes. They'll put together so stunning, but cozy. Another great example, it's a little more lax, but it's definitely not a cozy quote unquote outfit, but it looks cozy. Cozy chic and being cozy are very different. Cozy is like a giant baggy hoodie, and this is cozy chic. She has a full outfit together, but she's so comfortable. She's so cozy. She has the uggs, the jacket, the shirling. She's got comfortable pants on. Eany, I love this, and I'm obsessed with this. Another great example, how you might have seen it a bit more, is just the nice boots, pants jacket. It's more lax. You're actually very comfortable in what you're wearing. It's cozy and it's chic and you look really cool at the same time. Here's another example. It's a very lax outfit. She's got a nice chunky sweater on. I absolutely love this. I think this trend really rolls into ski chic as well, which she looks like she's going skiing. She's not. We talked about this in the fashion world for quite some time now. Huge this year. She looks like she's just out and about, going her ski vacation. You look like you're in a ski lodge. Other Mary-Janes are absolutely huge during fall, and they will for sure be a trend during this winter season. We're seeing so many different companies, great products that are taking on a bunch of different takes. Great example. It's a classic Mary-Janes silhouette. It's got a little wood platform detailing to it, and it's a little different than what we're used to. I love that. Another great example of how we're seeing it is it's becoming more of a platform. We're adding a lot of different silhouettes and again, coloring to it. This is so cute. I think it's stunning and really, really wearable if you don't like the classic Mary-Janes. We're also seeing the Mary-Janes and the ballet flat kind of integrate into one shoe almost, especially like a kitten heel, ballet flat, but a Mary-Janes silhouette. We're seeing it in so many different fun colors now, such as red and green. It's also aren't going anywhere. They're only going to be integrated more into winter trends. I think what the biggest takes that I've really seen for what we're going to see during winter trends is accessorize, accessorize, accessorize. We're seeing outfits really become artwork instead of just the clothes that you're wearing, and we're doing that by having these fun things like biker boots and this fun, like, strip a jacket detailing that she has. Just this tie, she has this purse, and any kind of outfit that you're seeing that's trending this year, attention to how they're accessorizing because that's what's really going to elevate your whole outfit."," trend alert, guys, I'm so convinced that we've entered the second wave of the leisure. I think the first wave of the leisure was something along the lines of like I'm pretending I'm being chill but you know this whole Nike set was premeditated. But I'm noticing this trend that I'm so here for and that is the athletic shorts is casually plopped into an outfit. Though we have it to wearing athletic shorts with the Mary Jane's absolutely sent me. Something that's just so casual and laissez-faire about sporting the sports shorts like it's an afterthought. But then you pair with something more formal. I'm just obsessed."," talk really fast on the chokehold that denim has on it. I'm obsessed. I want denim everything. Denim shoes, denim purses, denim, top shorts, pants, blouses, anything. I want denim everything. I'm gonna show you a few things that I've come across that I think are essential for those of us that are in the chokehold of the denim. I'm gonna start with this one here. I actually shared it just the other day. One of my OOTD videos currently on sale. I'm obsessed. It's so soft and breathable. And it's the one that has the three buttons down the back. It's so cute. You gotta go look. These rhinestone shorts, like, are you kidding me? Sold out in a lot of sizes, but there are a few left. So I had to include them. Unfortunately, my size is gone. This handbag, I can't get enough. How adorable. I love it. Denim, everything I'm telling you. I haven't had a denim skirt and I don't know how long but this one, I'm obsessed and I feel like I have to have it. I love the color, I love the wash, I love the way it looks like it fits. I hope it fits the same on me as it does on the model. I'm obsessed. Something about a cuffed short. I just really love versus a distressed short. I just think this is more put together and I feel like you could dress this up more if you needed to or wear a casual. Another handbag. I love the style of this. I have a brown kind of cognac color, leather, it bag like this. And I just love the little patchwork detail with the chain strap. Denim, yes please. Another one like a little denim clutch. I love it. I died when I saw it. I think it is so cute. I love it. These shoes I am obsessed. It is a take on the Air Maze Dope with the added strap across the top of your foot but denim, when I saw this shoe and it was actually an ad on my Instagram, I immediately clicked it to go see where I could purchase this. I love it. So much. So really love these shorts. I like that they're longer but still cut out a little bit. But I just, I think it's so trendy, very age appropriate for me. It's like a mom short. It just screams like I could take my son to the park in these shorts and not feel uncomfortable or like I have short shorts on. Another take on those Air Maze Dope shoes that I showed you with the strap but like the actual Air Maze Dope shoe with denim. Like, oh, I'm gonna end it on a bank. Look at this shoe. I must have this shoe. It's like the Raffia, the woven, the chunky block you'll like all the things that I need. I hope that was helpful. Let me know if you have any questions at all. Tsk."," I just finished ordering a ton of new inventory for spring and these are my 2023 spring trend predictions. Okay, first we have the denim maxi skirt which I'm sure you've already been seeing everywhere, but I was a little skeptical about this and now the more I see it, the more I fall in love with it. This just is such an effortless look and jeans go with everything, but also with this slit in here, it makes it a lot more functional and easy to move around in. And while we're on the topic of denim, these denim jackets aren't going anywhere, especially in an oversized look. And we're going to be seeing a ton of denim on denim outfits. This is a slide. We're also going to be seeing a ton of maxi skirts like this one in a nice light like linen material. This one as well and this one of course. And while we're on this one, we're also going to be seeing a ton of crochet which is no surprise for spring. More crochet sweaters with maxi skirts and a ton of two piece crochet sets like this one I'm obsessed with. And we're also going to see a ton of crochet shrugs like this one, this one, and ones with some fun colors in them. Another style I've seen popping up everywhere is this ladder knit material which we're going to see a ton of in dresses like these. And tops like these, especially for festival season. Another trend we're seeing a ton of is this lime green light green color. This color is just so beautiful and I think it's going to be the color of spring."," Winter outfit in-spo for all the moms out there. Anybody can take outfit in-spo from this, but I use it for moms because they have flat shoes. You can bend down, you can chase kids, all the things. Trends right now are super minimal. We're not seeing a lot of pattern. Instead, we're seeing a lot more texture. So get yourself a chunky sweater, add in a belt if you're feeling a little bit too plain and you're good to go. I always get asked how to style a flat boot. And I really like these chunky boots with a more slim gene because I feel like it adds a little bit more volume on the bottom, you have the volume with the trench coat, and then you have the slimmer pieces underneath that creates a really nice balance. A great staple for you guys to add in would be a long trench coat or a long cardigan like this one. This just adds another dimension to your outfit, another layer which we love in the winter. It just looks so chic and effortless. To all the moms out there, I hope these outfits were helpful. Let me know which one was your favorite and let me know if you guys need more outfit in-spo."," Let's talk about one of my favorite trends we're gonna see this fall. Leather everything. Obviously we all know that leather is nothing new. But we are going to see everything made out of it. I'm so here for it. I'm obsessed with this outfit. Giving that bad bitch vibe. But make it chic with pink pumps. If a full on leather outfit is a little too much for you, here are a couple subtle ways to add it into your wardrobe. Having leather pants is a great staple piece, because then you can dress it up or down with other pieces. I also love how they can take such a casual outfit, but elevate it. Sneaks, trench coat, run your errands, but make it elevated. Don't even get me started on the leather trench coats. The trench coat is the coat of the season. Throw it over a pair of jeans, white tea, make it casual with sneakers, more pumps. Ugh, I'm here for this. If the trench coat isn't your jam, grab a blazer. Make it and we can make it sexy. Or make it casual with a pair of jeans, tenies and a tank. There are so many good ways to incorporate leather into your fall wardrobe. Comment, let me know which ones are your favorite. Make sure you're liking and following a lot of more faction trends. I'm always tagging all of my full outfits over on Instagram, so be sure to find me over there too."," Five summer trends you'll actually want to wear. First up is knitwear like this or this, maybe even as a matching set or for the neutral girlies. Next is dresses and blazers, whether you want a monochromatic look, pops of color or neutrals. Next trend is anything with ruffles and I am so obsessed. Like this, this, speechless. Matching swim sets. Do I need to say more? You already know. Even like this, so good. And lastly, a little tied sweater. So effortless, so chic. That's me. Also me, I love this trend."," Here are the top five fashion trends we should be expecting this spring and summer. How my name is Aisha and my goal here is to help you elevate your look from head to toe. I want you guys to look exquisite. Okay, like straight money. If you haven't noticed already color is back and better than ever. We're going to see a lot more color blocking outfits and outfits with pop of colors. So this one right here is a few pieces from the Jacques Mouk collection called this Liss Blash collection I believe and yeah it's beautiful. The lavender, the pink together. It's just, um, chef's kiss. Here's another example of that pop of color. We have two beautifully coordinated outfits. We have the blue, the bright orange and the fact that it ties in with the neutrals, it just kind of tones it down in a different way. So I love this. Here's another example. Just gorgeous. And for all my girls who don't have a lot of color in their wardrobe already, this is a perfect example of how you can have an all black outfit and all you need is an accessory that has a pop of color and automatically adjusts you up and elevates the look as you can see. So that's perfect.",,," Rachel Kaye here and today I'm going to be showing three summer forecasting trends for summer 2021. These are all just predictions, so do not take my word for this, but I have some evidence to kind of back up my theories here. The first trend I think is going to be super trendy in summer 2021. Please please please trust me, our platform flip flops. The two thousands are back, juicy cattour track suits are back, and flip flops are back as well. I love this, I really hope they come back and trend because I am going to buy a pair. The reason why I think that is because platforms already are in trend again. I mean last summer we had the whole like espadrill, like espadrill kind of moment, and then we had platform boots and disco boots, and frankies, bikinis are launching a platform flip flop line, so I'm really excited. Every summer there is a hair trend last year, it was like the hair wraps with the bead this year is going to be hair tensile. I already ordered mine and I scheduled an appointment with my hairdresser, so clearly I'm obsessed. Stay tuned for part two."," This yellow body con on glove the bus. Feet springy jacolomist tube. This pink gingham dress is a cottage cord ring. A fun sage denim jacket for spring. These colorful blazers were so fun and they had matching trousers. This dress oh my god, the bag.",,,,

You were a trend that we're starting to see come into spring. As a reason is ballet core, ballet core is really having its moment because we do see a lot of coquette influencer in spring. I love this top because it's giving old money but also ballet core combined into one. And it's very practical for the weather. With a pair of with this skirt, I have this. This is one of the most amazing skirts ever. And having a white pleated or with a lace skirt is a huge trend this spring and a great staple piece as well because of all the influencer boho. It's a bold money and everything else. And lastly, I pair it with this as well. This is a great shoe to have because it is very ballet core. But it's going to be so cohesive in your closet and also a classic. We're seeing embellishments and big metal pieces added to everything, also seeing woven, be material and texture. And just an overall trend this season. So I love this combination and you can really style any kind of cover up to be a going out dress as well. With the proper undergarments, cropped trench will be your spring coat staple. We're also continuing to see this way trend and absolutely everything. So I love this variation of it. I think this is beautiful and stunning. We still need jackets because it's still spring. Whether we'll be back and forth, but this is stunning. Lovers of all kinds and kit and heels are some of the biggest trendings for these shoes that we're seeing. So I love this because it kind of combines the two looks. It's a very coquette. It has little heart details. We're also seeing embellishments like I mentioned previously. I love the color blocking of this. It's just so beautiful. You can go into so many different directions and I think that's what you want to look for in shoes. Seeing a huge influence of retrocomments where I love these sunglasses. And while we're moving towards the smaller slimmer sunglasses, it's a huge spring statement piece. And I love this. And we've seen dresses like this everywhere. This is a fantastic base piece as well with a neck piece what we're really gravitating towards and where we're seeing the trend really come into style. Also getting a top like this. We're seeing denim become either very structured or very unstructured. So I do really like this light wash pair of joggers. We'll see them very much take this form as well as the hyper structured versions. And I love this flap because it's giving designer but it's also so beautiful. It's spring, but it still seems classy. So seeing a lot of hops like this. So I think this is great for your spring outfits because you can very much take this into summer and style it in many different ways, but it's so cute."," Hello friends. So today I thought we could chat about winter 2024 trends. What we can expect I'm going to also give you guys some thoughts on these styles and give you some inspo. For those who don't know me, my name is Megan and I own an online boutique called Musin Mavin boutique. It's got the cutest styles for women. Just must have looks, trendy, classics, basics, all the things. So if you haven't checked it out, please do. Okay, so for the first look, we are going to see a lot of oversized bags this winter. Micro like mini bag was super popular at one point. Now you're going to see a lot of these oversized styles. I'm loving this look in particular because this kind of chunky sweater vibe is really popular for winter. I love the trench look. It's so effortless. It's very cozy. It's all the things that as women want to look and feel like this winter. As always, I love the trouser. It's just a classic staple and I think for winter in this particular style and color, it's really good for you ladies who kind of like that street look a little bit elevated. I give this look like, I give it like a 10 out of 10. I love it. All right, the metallic trend is definitely one to see this winter. Would I wear this? I'm not sure. It would have to be the right occasion to share it with you guys because this particular pant with the kind of cinched in ankle is super popular for winter. Kind of out like parachute pant vibe. Metallic is something that's just it's sticking around for some reason. What do you guys think? Can you get in on this trend? Okay, I do however like the look of the metallic shoe. Super classy. It's fun. It's a way to kind of accessorize the outfit and kind of go with the trends, but it doesn't have to be too overbearing. This particular boot style, I think is so cute. Super fun. And I love it. Okay, this look is perfection. A trend that we're kind of assessing here is the corset. This type of like corseted belt situation is a super chic way. To kind of accentuate the waist, give you some shape. Love how she paired this collared kind of button up dress with the corset and then the tall boot. Everything is just so cohesive. You ladies, this is something I encourage you to try, especially if you like to give yourself that nice like snatched in. So all right ladies, what did you guys think? Do you guys like any of these styles? Did you get a little in-spo? I hope this encourages you guys to kind of step out of your box, try some new things this winter. I'm looking forward to like the cozy oversized looks. Like, that's my vibe. I will hopefully do a part two soon. Is that something that you guys want to see? Let me know in the comments. Love you guys."," are already halfway through October and if you want to dress something like this but you don't know where to start, this is for you. I'm gonna go through some simple outfit formulas of items you probably already have in your closet. Put some cute outfits together. Part two. Starting with this mini skirt and oversized jacket or sweater look. Do it with boots, no tights, a lot of pair of loafers and socks. Love how the jacket or the oversized sweater kind of meet at the same line as the mini skirt. So here we go. The great outfit to layer for fall. I never go wrong with an oversized leather bomber but a thrift one of these in a men's section. Same outfit, different font. This outfit has such a hold on me. I was able to find and link very similar items. If you will jacket is such a capsule piece for fall. This one is half-off at J-Crew. Also half-off at quince. Next outfit, I love for fall is matching a white trouser with a black top. Add some sophistication by tucking it in with a black belt. So many different black tops or sweaters or blazers would work for this. Love it with a high neck black tank. Little pop of this burgundy color with a bag. You'd dress it up with black boots or dress it down with some sneakers. And this jacket from Mango is so chic. See how they styled the model. Black top, white bottom, so good. As we have a total monochrome look, Chocobrown seems to be everywhere but this is such a classic option. I'm digging the brown full head to toe but it also looks good with just a white tee. Even this little pop of blue and this set from Dish. So good. Add a little texture with this made-well bag. These sling back pumps with the gold detail. Done. Again, I guarantee you have a lot of these items in your closet. You just need to put them together. But regardless, everything is linked in my bio under fall outfit in slow. Let me know if you want to part three. Ciao."," Okay, let's stop 2024 trends. A trend that I'm loving and really excited about in 2024 is the cinch blazer, while the oversized jacket is still going to be in, there's going to be more attention drawn to the waist. I love this example here. I think it's such a good combination of the oversized jacket with that cinch waist. Here's another great example. This jacket also has wider shoulders, which is something that I think that we're going to be seeing a lot more of. And here's another example where it's a little bit oversized except for in the waist and bottom portion. I'm super interested to hear other people's opinions. So do like the oversized blazer better or the tailored."," Summer 2024 fashion. Let's talk about it. Stripes, linen and PJ pants are going to be huge. I pulled this look from Pinterest. I'm not exactly sure if she's wearing striped pants, but these look like striped PJ pants to me and this outfit is so cute. I love that the yellow is on the top of the sneakers and the blue stays on the pants. I'll have a couple good options for pants linked on my like to know it. These pants are more boxer style, but again they're very casual PJ pants, but dressed up with a denim jacket. This is everything to me. Here's an easy summer look. I just threw together quick just a plain white tank, your pants and a pair of orange sneakers. I love pairing blue with orange or yellow. It's just a little bit of a contrast that looks good together. Here's another option with green as your color for kind of more St. Patrick's Day vibes. And this is a very different take with a sweatshirt with graze and silver tones. So many different ways to style these. Let me know what your guys' thoughts are. Do we like the boxer pants? Do we like the PJ pants? The linen pants? I'll take any excuse to be casual yet cute, so I'm definitely 100% hopping on this trend."," Stop saying you have nothing to wear this winter because I can guarantee you have these staples in your closet. You have two to three statement jackets, pretty much good to go. For example, with this outfit, all she's wearing is a black turtleneck, blue jeans, and a pair of sneakers, which I know you probably have. But what really pulls the outfit together is the long black trench coat. Another example is this one where she's just wearing again a neutral colored top, jeans, probably a boots, but the statement jacket is what makes the outfit. Another example of this, she's wearing again, Uggs, jeans, probably a neutral colored top. But the furry coat is a statement piece, it's what pulls the outfit together and makes it interesting. And then she also added a scarf, which I love. That can add a lot to the look as we can see here. This one is an example that's a little bit dressier. We can't even see what she's wearing under the jacket, but it looks like a dress. This is a very nicely put together outfit and all it really is is a black coat, black scarf, and black gloves. I know you have neutral tops or body suits in your closet that you like, a few pair of jeans that you love, and probably a pair of two of boots, which means if you don't have a couple of statement jackets, that's really all you're missing and maybe a couple of scarves. No more complaining about having nothing to wear this winter until you've tried this."," 2023 trend prediction fall edition. Red is gonna continue to be huge for fall that's on their own way. Again, and again, especially gonna see this a lot in sweaters. I mentioned this before, studded belts are gonna be everywhere. We're gonna see them like this, and like this, tennis necklaces are also making a huge return. I think we're also gonna see a lot of sheer skirts paired with the really oversized sweaters. We're also gonna see lip prints, yes, I'm serious, and the return of shiny denim."," new season comes around, I always want to know what key items to have on rotation in my closet. Let's run through a summer capsule wardrobe collection. This way you guys can maximize your outfits with the least amount of items. In the summertime you're running around a bit more, your headed to the beach, the pool, the lake and whatnot. Whatever items you're throwing over your bathing suit or quickly changing into to head out to dinner, you want it to match everything and you want them to fit well. Starting with bases, a nice light wash pair of Levi's, I absolutely love mine. I pulled mine from the dirty laundry to show you guys because I wear them so much, but having a pair that fits you really well, you know, is going to match everything. You don't mind throwing them on over your bathing suit or whatnot. They're just a great option. I absolutely love mine. I love how they're a little bit distressed and worn, so there's no stress when you're running around from place to place. Next on the high priority list are a pair of linen pants. I honestly found these at a thrift shop for around $3. There are my go-to. They're super comfortable and stretchy, so when you still want to look a little bit put together but you want to be comfortable, maybe go for a linen pant. I absolutely love having these in my closet in the summertime just to go over bathing suits when it's super hot out and I really want something lightweight but kind of elevates my outfit. Obviously it's summer, so we're sharing shorts here of different washes and lengths and designs and whatnot. I think having a light wash pair, a dark wash pair and then a white pair are honestly perfect in all you need. These ones are from Park. I love the length of them. They are definitely a little bit on the shorter side, but I love the clean hem on them. I feel like it makes it easy to wear them a little bit shorter. These ones are from Z Supply. I've talked about these ones before. They are my absolute favorite baggy shorts. I think I ordered a size up so they fit a little bit looser. I love having shorts that kind of vary also in like how tight they are as well and I love the difference here with the fray bottom and then also having a white pair of jean shorts. I'm actually wearing these ones. These ones are from Redone. I really love these. I think I also ordered a size up just because I prefer a baggy outfit but it's preference for everyone but yeah really great option to have shorts of different washes, different lengths, designs, whatnot. And then obviously if you want to have a bit more fun but still keep it versatile, go for a pair of boxer shorts that maybe is a bit more on the neutral side like the brown stripes are going to match everything but if you're really wanting to dive deep into color and not be afraid of it, go for like a fun like light pastel and pair like pink yellow blue that you'll honestly be in disbelief at how much they honestly match a lot of different colors but boxer shorts are definitely the go-to especially as bathing suit cover-ups on a hot day out if you don't want denim touching your body and it's just like extremely humid pair of boxer shorts. Also you will notice that every single item will be able to go with each other so you could make like a million truly different outfits out of all these pieces because every single one of them can go with each other. And then one more bottom item that is definitely a must-have for me that I actually talked about in my spring capsule wardrobe collection is a long skirt she's definitely being carried with me into summer. I absolutely love the wash of this one or color of this one. I feel like it goes with a lot of different things so versatile from the beach to dinner and to casual days like this can honestly be dressed up and dressed down in so many different ways. Now moving into tops obviously a white t-shirt and a white tank top. I will say I am specific on the fit. I will try and find something of a design that is a bit more flattering for my body type so then I'm more prompted to wear. I know how it fits on me. I really like how it's flattering on me and so I usually go for more of like a baby style longer t-shirt and then I usually always go for a high neck tank top just because that's how I prefer the fit on me but yeah just aside note like if you're investing in a little bit of basics maybe go for ones that you know are flattering for your body type so then you're prompted to wear them more. Maybe you're like Lauren I really want to take a little bit more of a risk this summer and be a little bit more fun so go for a colorful baby t-shirt or tank top you know add some color in with just some simple tops. This one is from Brandy Melville I absolutely love the pastel yellow of it and then this one is from H&M I absolutely love it because it is a bit more of an elevated design with the roof on the side but it's still a t-shirt material so maybe go for something that is still basic and comfortable for you but has a little bit of an elevated design to kind of like you know step up your game if you're interested. Definitely a big t-shirt of the summer is key for me I am obsessed with this one from glass on's I think this is your opportunity to play with a fun graphic especially with an oversized t I just feel like they're key for throwing over your bathing suits you could wear them with box or shorts you can wear them with little shorts and tuck it in with a belt you know the vibes but oversized t-shirt is just always the call. Honestly I think having a couple of elevated tops that are for special events like going out heading out to dinner if you're with friends during the day and you guys are doing something special have a couple of tops that you know you're gonna have fun wearing so this is one for me this one's from Reformation and I'm absolutely obsessed with it I know Princess Paulie has a very similar one a way lower price but I absolutely love the low back of it I love how it's a vest it's a denim material so it matches everything it's just super versatile even though it is like a specialty specialty top and then I also even love the one that I'm wearing I just feel like it's so cute it can honestly be worn unbuttoned with like a little bra let underneath or buttoned up like how I'm wearing it right now I just feel like this could be dressed up for like a nighttime occasion and during the day as well so having a couple of tops for those options are great this summer I definitely do not lean towards layers just because it's so hot but I think having a couple of options is great so having a button down this one's a pinstripe brown so it goes with a lot of different things I love this one it's from free people goes over bathing suits it's long enough to kind of like cover the zone so you know you can use it as a cover up or even as a dress and I also love how this can be thrown over like cute tank tops with bag jeans with shorts it could be buttoned up it can be unbuttoned there's a lot of options with this or you could go in with just like a fun colored cardigan and have like a colorful cardigan of the summer and it's like you're always it's always your go-to this one is from sazon I absolutely love the baby blue of it I feel like this honestly goes with a lot I have sneakers of this color and they match pretty much everything but yeah having just a couple of options is great you don't need a lot because it's so hot out and I hope it's hot out where you are in the summer so you know of course you got to have your go-to sunglasses for the summer these are super comfortable yet very cute this one is from the grade I absolutely love it you guys have seen this one before it's super light way I honestly have been wearing this one more casual but this also has the option to be dressed up which is great and then I love having lighter option and then a darker option this one is from z-supply it is so beautiful but so simple and I really really love this one it's just like a nice elevated approach to a black sundress you could have so much from the sneakers or sandals with this one you could wear it as a peach cover up you know the vibe so having a staple one dark and one light and shoe wise honestly all I reach for are these three different types obviously having a fun sneaker option at these ones are from gola I know they have these in a bunch of different color ways so if you want to spice it up with a different color go for it I have just really been loving the simple black and white I think they're so cute very comfortable so if you're traveling a lot and in summer I just feel like you're moving a lot you're moving around more in general so having comfortable sneaker that will last all day and you're not going to complain about the top of my list are definitely hobby honest I absolutely love wearing these in the summertime there's so chic so versatile so comfortable they go with everything you could honestly dress them up for a chic like dressier look or even dress them down for a casual beach look they're just 10 out of 10 and they're so affordable I think these are like $15 and then last but not least having a dressier option like these mesh flats they will match everything obviously because they're practically see through but you could honestly go for an elevated sandal or whatnot but I just love this for an option to dress up sun dresses like jeans in a tank top even so if you're headed out to dinner and you want to stay comfortable but be a little bit more elevated try like a versatile pair of flats or even like an elevated sandal keep it simple then last but not least but I feel like this is important because it's summer having a key pair of sunglasses for the summer these ones are from Las Vegas I absolutely love how classic and timeless they are the design and chef's kiss they are the ones I'm always grabbing and they're actually a pretty good price for how nice they look but yeah great quality 10 out of 10 definitely go for a staple pair of sunnies for the summer and that was my summer capsule wardrobe collection let me know if you guys have any questions hopefully this helped you guys build an idea of what is key as we head into the warmer season but hope you guys are having a good day bye"," Okay, so today I'm going to show you guys the things that I'm going to be wearing this spring and summer of 2023 using all photos that I got from Pinterest and all the photos are with only people of color in them because I Really wanted to make sure that this inspa board has people that look like me on it. So starting off with skirts I'm really going for like a lot of like maxi dress skirts like very comfy though Still very like casual with the sneakers A t-shirt over it. We also have like this vibe which is kind of more elevated, but still somehow dressed down I honestly might get a denim maxi skirt as someone who was homeschooled This was the most embarrassing thing growing up because all the homeschoolers were shit like this And if I had known that growing up I would have kept one one more example of a Longer skirt and a t-shirt vibe like this is what we're going for for my going out looks I'm not doing mini skirts this this year. No mini skirts this summer. I am doing pants. I'm doing baggy and I'm doing A more feminine silhouette on top and then a baggy or silhouette on the bottom That's what I feel most comfortable in potten like matched with a pair of heels whatever This vibe same thing baggy pants pair of heels a cute purse Fitted top love one more for good measure for like the everyday wear It's kind of the same thing as the going outwear just dress down More casual t-shirt But still fitted crop tops that vibe. I'm really trying to like push my boundaries style wise I want to try stuff like this more like I just love How unique this is but it's still like all muted tones like Neutral's like I'm not really a colorful person when it comes to clothes So I really like that this is still really fun. I think the sunglasses are also really big I really want to wear like more big fun sunglasses more casual everyday look baggy crop top you get the vibe This is also like the hair we're going for this summer cute casual laidback, but like very chic to add to the hair I want to go for this color. I'm literally going to dye my hair I want it to be this color. I like the like reddish undertones, but it's still dark I don't want to do anything like blonde like that's not for me. I just love how this looks. It's so pretty Obviously, I had to throw miscravids in here. Um, I'm very much into mesh and see through tops this year So all mesh all see through I will be wearing a bra under mine, but that's just for me another example I probably won't let subtract the coat since it's you know spring and summer, but you get the vibe We'll also be wearing a lot of baggy light colored pants I found one more example of like dressed up going out baggy pants fitted top"," Winter 2021 and 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major. First up, y'all already know what fur trim coats are everything this season. Similarly, any fur trim sweater, I actually rented this exact one. Just about everything about this, the fur coat, the super dramatic fur hat, the stockings, and the super chunky heels. And of course, we have feathers. And just about anything feather trimmed. Going with that, this wispy feathery material, I think we're about to see much more of. Next up, the aviator jacket. It is so popular this year and with good reason, I love just about anything with cheerling. Speaking of cheerling, just about anything with cheerling. Like bags, shoes, which brings us to moon boots and yes, for practicality reasons, but also just for fashion. It's giving very ugly vibes.", These are some of the biggest fall 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major. First up we have bomber jackets. Back at it again. But a little less like this and more like this. With more of an oversized fit and I'm especially seeing them a lot in leather. Literally one comment and I'll buy this one. I'm this close. I love it. Next up another piece of outerwear. Racing jackets. I know we've all seen this outfit. They're so hot right now. Like this. This. I'm seeing them both slimmer and baggy. And a lot of what we're seeing has a very vintage-esque style to it. It reminds me a lot of the varsity jackets we saw last year. The amount of time like for part five.," This is going to be one of the biggest trends for spring and summer, 2022. From a fashion major. This has been one of my favorite styles for so long so I cannot be happier that it's super popular this year and that is this type of pattern. I'm calling it the postcard pattern because it just gives off a vibe of a postcard from like somewhere in Europe, somewhere tropical, just very like European vacation vibes. I love it. Okay, that one had actual postcards on it but it can also be like this, just very abstract, colorful, same vibe. Or something like this, it just has a very vintage print feel to it. Like this, here's another example. Reminds me a lot of the newspaper print that we're seeing a lot of like this. It also reminds me a lot of the Matisse prints or coffee table books that are really popular. I'm also seeing a lot and more abstract patterns like this or this or in more watercolor ask prints like this. It's giving like 90s retro, I love it. Like this print, y'all, oh my gosh, I love it. But really one single comment and I'll buy it."," this is going to be at spring and summer 2022 trends that I am personally going to be wearing from somebody who went to school for fashion. Okay, first up are trousers. Not only are they cute, but they're comfortable and you can literally make an outfit out of anything with these. They always look good, I swear. Here's another really cute trouser example. Next up are white jeans. I feel like I have not seen anybody wearing these up until recently and I used to not be on the white jeans train, but I love it now. I think they're so cute. You can do so much with them. I got mine from Abercrombie. They're more like a cream, but honestly cream white. They're such good quality and I love them. Here is another really cute outfit example with the white or cream jeans, but what I want to talk about here is the oversized blazer. I actually just got one from Windsor, almost in this exact same color. I love them for any time of year, but honestly doing these cute like pastel colors in spring and summer is just chef's kiss. Next up when I say that these sets have had a choke hold on my Pinterest. They are all over. I literally have one coming in the mail right now. I'm so excited to wear it. I think they're so cute. You can do it over a bikini. You could dress it up a little bit more wear it to dinner. Oh my gosh, you could do so much with these. Here is more of a beachy vibe for this set. Oh, I can't get over them. They're so cute. Honestly, anything in this pleasay material I am down for at this point. Along with the oversized blazers, these oversized button-down shirts are so cute. Again, you can dress these up. You can throw them over a bikini. I'm going to be doing that a lot this summer. I got these in so many different colors so that I have one to match with like every bikini I own. Here's another one styled really, really cute. I love this look so much. I'm going to be doing this color of a blue top with my white jeans in the summer. Oh, it's so cute. I know this is more like a basic than a trend, but styling workout sets up really well with cute sneakers, cute accessories, jewelry purses, whatever it might be is such a cute comfy way to look so put together. Here's another really cute example. Also, this color green has been popping off the last year and I honestly don't think it's going away anytime soon. Also, the strappy kitten heels are definitely going to make a comeback this spring and summer. I have so many cute pairs. I can't wait to wear them again. I love these. Lastly, I think a super cute way to accessorize is getting some of these scarves and wearing them in your hair. It's also perfect if you're having a bad hair day.",,," What are we wearing this summer? So a lot of fashion forecasts were saying that loungewear was going to be the thing but actually the opposite. Glam is back with a lot of retro references. It's definitely party vibes. This connects them to the Halt & Ectron and the printing color that we're seeing at the moment. We're also going to keep seeing two piece swimwear, long shorts and the open shirt wouldn't top situation as well."," That spring trends where the florals were spraying is not groundbreaking, but this spring they're brighter and they're bolder. We're also going to be seeing a lot of mini dresses with boots. They get too hot where I live to wear this, but I'm obsessed. I told you Founcy tops are in and they're not going anywhere. Instead of the little black dress, it's all about a little white dress. You need this. Like for the next part.",,,,
,," spring trends are out. So let's see some spring 200 by fashion trends that you can offer with Amazon so you can wear all the cute spring outfits and trends this season let's go into it. First off, headscarves are absolutely one of the biggest trends that we'll be seeing this year. In terms of accessorizing, we are all going to be wearing headscarves and I've got almost an exact match to this. I love it if not an exact match. We all are going to look so cute in these. I'm obsessed with it. Also this blue one is gorgeous, it looks so expensive. Another huge trend that we'll be seeing also paired with the headscarves are these oval glasses. We'll start to see these really oval more elongated little glasses. We'll see all kinds of glasses this season but this will be a huge spring trend. We've seen kitten heels like this. I love the chocolate swayed and of course in white with absolutely everything it'll be paired with the boho chic. It'll be paired with more feminine, dainty, old money, nautical looks as well. It'll be one of the trending shoes for spring. On that same topic, we're seeing a lot of preppy and nautical influence this season in terms of spring trends so I love the stress I have this and I adore it. It looks so beautiful. It looks so chic and can be worn more street style. A little more dressed up, a little more old money and preppy. Also, start to see more dresses like this. Always in and always in trending style. Also, but of course it's a little shorter for spring. I love this combination because it's old money, it's preppy but it still spring. It's wearable during hot weather. Oho chic is one of the biggest trends I'll be seeing as well as the fishermen aesthetic. We'll start to see them kind of combined so we'll see a lot of crochet materials because it's a little more bohemian because the style is bohemian but the crochet is getting fishnet almost. How we'll start to see it integrated with one another. It's so cute and very wearable of course going to the beach. Also a very wearable outfit with everything underneath because we're doing a lot of sheer this year. Sure you're starting to notice a trend in our trends. We're seeing a lot of maximalism, a lot of accessorizing so we're going to see a lot of chunky jewelry like this and with that with a lot of texture as well. So I love this combination because it has everything that you need right there. I personally also love this as well for the more tailored looks. The preppy we're going to start to see integrated into spring looking a lot like this because it makes it wearable. It's a little more relaxed but it's still giving that preppy vibe with it gives old money but I love this blue I think it's gorgeous. I'll see so many vests. Hidden heels are of course a huge trend this season like mentioned prior but I love this blue and I think those two together would be so so cute perfect outfit easy go to. I've been talking about textured being a trend and we'll see a lot of bags like this. I had of course a lot of wicker and straw bags just like this."," What cool girls will be wearing for winter 2025? Part four. Plotform Uggs are still in the top training shoes for winter but instead of the classic chestnut color we're going to be seeing it in this dark brown. The dark brown color almost brings the Ugg to like a whole new level and I stand by the back that I think the Uggs go with everything. If you aren't into the plot from Uggs the tazmin slippers and the brown color also a really great option. Off shoulder sweaters. I really like how the off the shoulder dresses up the sweater. I just love how cutesy and flirty the style is. Country core. Think wool coats, plaid, knee high boots. And if you can manage it I do think shorts even make it more of a country-esque vibe. Another really great example. I just love the trench coat mixed with the rubber boot. Also I think we're going to be seeing a lot of green and brown plaid. Brown. Brown is going to be the ultimate color for winter. Really compliments a lot of skin tones of a brown coat specifically the wool style or even like a brown boot so cute can really just not go wrong with brown."," winter 2024 trends that are worth investing in. So I spent a few weeks looking at Pinterest and scrolling through thousands of runway looks so you don't have to. And there are a ton of trends out there, but I think these are the trends that are worth your money because they'll continue to be around season after season. So number one, we have long coats. A long coat will instantly elevate your outfit. Although it might look like it's a trend because it's everywhere, it's actually a classic. A long coat will keep you warmer because it covers everything. I love this long cream coat, it just creams luxury. Number two is burgundy. We've seen the color burgundy over Pinterest and across the 2024 runway collection. Like Gucci, YSL, such a rich color. It's so elegant and chic and can act as a neutral one. I love seeing it in tights, heels or accessories like embags. Next we have pointed toe heels. They're worth investing in because they always come back and they elongate your legs. These YSL ones are living in my head, rent-free. Moving on, we have sheer tights. Tight trends appear every winter, but this year I feel like they've been given more attention and it's almost like tights are your accessory piece in the winter. So I love this look with the burgundy tights and this one with the lacy tights. It just makes basic outfit more interesting. Next we have gloves. Wearing gloves in the winter isn't a new thing. It's a classic, makes your fingers longer and look very classy. I love the short leather gloves here and the dramatic feel of the full length glove. Then we have the color blue. One of the 2024 trends is different tones of blue. And I've seen it in dresses and it suits. The color is so serene and it's calmer than the bold red color which we saw a lot in the fall. So you can style and it blue sweater with jeans like here or you can add blue through accessories like a scarf or shoes. Blue is a really good transition from a winter to spring wardrobe. So what do we think about these trends? Do we want a part two?", We'll see more of this year. I think long gloves are really going to have a moment and with that We're going to see a lot of 80s and spoke in general the stir up legging will be everywhere and we're going to see a lot of rug These and long sleep polos I just wrote about this on my sub stack and I'm honestly obsessed I think white blazers are going to have a huge return. They are so chic We are also going to see a lot of track pants paired with blazers like this and this I also think layering tops like this We really and hybrid shoes are really going to have a moment And I think we're going to see a lot of tights under jeans and like for the next part," If you want to be that girl that everybody's stopping you to ask where your outfits from, it's not Abercrombia Ritsia, but let me put you on because I've been shopping here for years. It's an Australian boutique called Mura boutique. Look at the scallop detail on the top and the skirt. It is to die for. Don't buy this unless you want to get stopped and get asked where your set is from. Look at the red, oh my god, the red embroidery on it. I am dying, vacation vibes. I've never wanted to buy a picnic basket so bad just to go in the grass and have a picnic in this dress. She's giving grease. I want to go. This size is killing me. Red, if red's not the year color, they have it in blue. Let me show you a better picture of this. This is brunch. Can somebody please invite me to a garden tea party because I really want to wear this so bad? I would kind of wear this when he's still too, maybe? I don't know, I think I would. Is orange in? Is orange going to come in? I get picture wearing this after a long day at the beach or the pool just throwing my hair up, putting this on comfortable. I'm going to book a ticket to Italy right now just so I could wear this outfit. Orange again. Is orange coming? I guess a part of being an influencer is I can't get keep anymore and I'm really sad because I've been shopping here for years. But if you don't want to get compliments on your outfit, don't shop here."," I feel like we're definitely all at a point where we're sick of winter, we're sick of winter outfits, we're sick of being cold. Unfortunately, we can't give up the winter wardrobe just yet. If you feel like you're out of winter outfit ideas, here's some ideas for you. This one's more of a practical tip, but remember to wear your basics, wear your undergarments. I feel like wearing a warm layer underneath is the perfect way to stay warm while still allowing yourself to have a little bit more fun on your outside layer, because you don't have to worry about bundling up this much. Personally, I like for my underlayers to be a little bit tighter, just because if I do baggy on baggy, it gets a little bit overstimulating for me personally. So tops like this are usually my favorite to wear either on their own or like under a sweater or under a jacket. It's why I pick between being warm and being chic when you're gonna be both. Next is to have a go to all-weather shoe. I know what you're thinking. Burkin stocks are all-weather shoes. In my wardrobe, they are. Unless it's extremely cold or the ground is wet with rain or snow. I'm probably wearing my Burkin stocks with a pair of socks. To me, yes, it is an all-weather shoe. I also still obsessed with my new Balance 530s. I got them for Christmas. I wear them every day. Again, to me, it is an all-weather shoe. I've worn them in the snow. I've worn them in the rain. And surprisingly, they keep my feet warm and dry. I also love a rain boot as an all-weather shoe. I love when someone styles a rain boot and makes it cute and chic. I particularly the hunter boots because I never got the vision for them until recently. And now I want a pair. If you do uggs, make sure you get the spray to spray the suede on them. My uggs are absolutely destroyed because they've gotten wet. So be better than me and get the spray. Whenever this time of year rolls around and I'm just sick of everything, winter, I'm sick of all of my winter clothes. The one thing that always has my back is my favorite pair of jeans. I truly feel like one of the best things you can invest in is a good, reliable, stylish, chic, perfectly fitting pair of jeans that you can wear all year round. Because yes, I wear jeans in the summer as well. I just feel like no matter who you are, no matter what your style is, a good pair of jeans is always a fallback for basically everybody. Especially in the winter when you're sick of everything and you don't know what to wear. I feel like the perfect pair of jeans kind of style themselves. And lastly, coats and accessories are a great way to really judge up your winter outfits and really start to have fun when you feel fatigued of everything that you have. Obsessed with this coat, obsessed with these gloves, obsessed with the shoes, I love the whole thing. Also, really loving balaclavas and when people tie their scarves around their head, love it, I think it's so chic. If I've said it once, I've said it before, a lot of your outfits are going to be covered by your coat in the winter time. So having fun with accessories is a great way to judge up your outfit. Back to this picture, matching the boots with the scarves is so good, I love it. Especially if it's a pop of color, you win. Okay, those are some tips if you're sick of winter styling, or I hope this helps."," Do you guys want to talk Fall 2023 fashion trends? Good, me too. Let's get ahead of it. I don't know about you, but once we start heading into August, summer is way in my review mirror and I'm already focused on fall pieces. I'm going to share five fashion trends we're going to be seeing moving into fall and then at the end I'm going to share pieces I love that fall within these categories. Everything will be linked on my LTK. The link is up my bio. Number one, we saw a lot of peplum tops coming down the runway. This one particularly is off the Tori Burr runway. But how that translates to everyday style is something like this. Obviously this is something a bit more summary, but you can wear a top like this in the fall with a blazer over at a bomber over at denim or something a bit more practical like this with the peplum bottom or something like this. When in doubt, monochrome it out. Or a peplum wrap top is always a good idea. Wrap top or wrap dress is a universally flattering shape on anyone. Being a minimalist doesn't have to mean boring case in point here. Adding a white peplum blouse adds a different silhouette and a point of interest. Number two, fall 2023 fashion trend is not really a trend. It's just more of getting back to the basics. Traditional tailoring, oversized pieces, great crisp white poplin button downs, relaxed denim. This is straight off the Gucci runway. We can start thinking about pulling out our oversized blazers or adding new ones to our closet like this or wearing oversized suiting like this. And I will always go back to the idea of an oversized suit because it's so versatile. You can wear the pieces separately. You can dress them up or down. You will never fail with a monochromatic base and an oversized blazer like this. Adding an oversized blazer to a mini skirt is always a great idea. I love the bottom of the blazer matches the bottom of the skirt. And just love the juxtaposition of something at leisure mixed with an oversized blazer like this. Number three fashion trend heading into fall is butter yellow. We've been seeing a lot of it moving into summer and it's not going anywhere in the fall. Love the idea of pairing it with some more of your neutral tones like grays and beiges and blacks. It's too overwhelming to wear head to toe. An oversized blazer in pale yellow is a great idea. Or why not just try a trouser. It sits really well with chocolate brown as well. Yellow is your color. Go for a matching set or a soft pretty yellow dress like this. Fourth trend moving into fall are circle midi skirts or skirts with a bit more volume. This is straight off the Prada runway. And we can take our voluminous spring and summer skirts and move them into fall by pairing them with boots or turtlenecks or long sleeve shirts or sweaters. You can easily take the skirt into fall by again pairing it with boots and a little cashmere knit. For a knit skirt like this with a bit more volume is always a great idea. Simple easy effortless pair down with kicks. Next trend moving into fall is a lot of sheer and transparency. You can reimagine a transparent dress like this with a turtleneck tights and boots or pair it down with kicks or why not just go for a sheer top and add a beautiful black braille. Whimsical effortless chic. And the last trend moving into fall that I will go over today is a lot of leather, particularly double leather like this. You could try double leather but different color leathers. If doubles too much try one statement coat. So cool and modern. Always love a black leather trouser. Pieces I love to shop this pepledon top from Cos. This from Toe. This top from Modern Citizen. Laser from Ac. Love the center from Citizen. And this denim from Neely Low Tand. Love the skirt from Banana."," Summer 2023 styles and trends from someone who used to dress thousands of women for a living before becoming a stay at home Mom, that's right. I said thousands. I used to own a women's clothing boutique here in my hometown So I kind of know a finger to these are going to be things that I personally own that I feel universally fit Almost every single body top and are universally on trend for multiple age groups things that I think are essential to have in your Cossets start off with these bermuda shorts here. These are new to me and I am obsessed with them They are the perfect length. They're high-rise a rigid denim Which if you do not know me yet, you will learn that rigid denim is my thing. I Swear by it. I think every single woman needs to wear a rigid denim over anything with stretch Dretchy jeans are just gonna hug you in all the wrong places.

You can dress it up with a dressier blouse. They are just They're so cute. Everkronbie has the best tees and you cannot tell me any different I have this baby doll tee in three colors now and it is the best fitting most comfortable tee I own if you don't like the tight Fitting of this one. They do have one that's a little bit looser fit for Those of us that don't like things super tight However, if you are gonna wear a baggy bottom make sure you do have a tighter fitted top It is going to look better. Your body is gonna look better It's just gonna be or if you have a looser top need a slimmer pant on bottom It's like that are just gonna be better Visually for our body and just make us feel better next onto my absolute favorite shorts for the summer aside from a denim These tailored shorts from Aberkronbie are Chef's kiss to shorts this summer. I have them in this navy color and they are my most worn short All spring and summer high rise long length I believe they're seven inch. I could be wrong could be six But they are just the perfect length in my opinion is so flattering with the pleats amazing amazing You have an event that you're going to the summer this dress is what you need to add to your closet I have this one and I'm obsessed the crisscross neckline is just very flattering for the shoulder and Your chest area and you don't have to wear the belt Part two, I'm sorry"," my spring fashion predictions. Oh, hit me. So I got four. Number one is the Nehi Biker boot. I've been looking for these. These are going to be the next big trend I promise you. The next one is 90s fluro accents. Graphic T's, bikinis. The first thing that popped into my hair, the fresh Prince of Bella. Yes. And like those windbreakers that everyone would wear that had the neon accents. Yeah. Chef's kiss. My next one, Kitten Heels. Watch this space because I haven't been a fan of Kitten Heels in the past, but I don't like wearing high heels. And then last one, which probably isn't necessarily one for me. Lots of like strapless bandos and strapless tops. A lot of declotage is going to be happening. This spring, this summer."," What are you guys right around the corner? So I'm gonna go over some trends that I am absolutely loving for this season. First up, we have these leather jackets with the fur trim on them. I am absolutely obsessed if I could find this exact jacket at the first door I would be able to die happy. It's just such a nice elevated take on the basic oversized leather jacket. Speaking of trim, how freaking gorgeous is this little jacket moment? I've been seeing these pop up everywhere, like the over exaggerated sleeve and color trim. Yes. Also, I know we all know that the platform ends their trending, but I wanna see them like this. Okay. This exact outfit actually, I wanna recreate immediately. And I know we all love a good chunky knit sweater, but I wanna see chunk, okay? I wanted to devour my body. I also haven't seen a lot of these sweaters lately, and I think they are stunning. A little deep v-neck. It makes it a little bit more elevated, but I love how this one is specifically like bigger, more billowy, so fun. It also will still be wearing the deconstructed academia style. This has me in a chokehold. Followin' like for part two."," Fall fashion trends 2022, we are all dressing like lesbians. Let me prove it to you. I was a gingers this evening, which is a lesbian barn, Brooklyn, and I was looking around, and it all clicked into place for me. First of all, vests. Vests! Are you kidding me? It's a bell curve. Everyone who is slightly masked was wearing vests right before they came out, right up until the immediate aftermath of coming out, right? Vests are the official uniform of the baby gay. Some lesbians take it a step farther and wear it for their whole lives, and now they're in for fall. Lesbians setting trends. Number two, Bergenstocks. I mean, come on. This one, one of the girls I was with was wearing Boston clogs, Bergenstocks. Not in a, they're new and trendy and like great for fall fashion way, but in a, I'm not new to this, I'm true to this. The Bergenstocks are a way of life for me, kind of way. I'm not going to fight with anyone on this. There are several articles about the lesbian Bergenstock connection. I'm not going to fight about the vests. I'm just saying, if you are on trend for fall 2022, drop to your hands and knees and think a lesbian."," love it or hated, low rise is back in. So let's talk about some low rise trends for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Yes, we are gonna be seeing lots of low rise. But also a lot of mid-rise styles, which I think are a great medium. Obviously we're seeing lots of low rise jeans. We're seeing a lot of low rise cargo pants, bonus points of their baggy. Like this or these. Also I'm seeing a baggy low rise paired a lot with corsets. I love it. We're seeing a lot of looser fitting low rise pants in general, like these, these, these, or these. If you're not quite comfortable with a full low rise, I'm seeing a lot of the angled waistline so it gives you illusion of low rise but the rest of it is regular. Like this or something more subtle like this. I think that I'm noticing a lot with the upcoming low rise trend is that it's not quite as extreme as it was in the 2000s. So instead of crazy, crazy low like this, something a bit more manageable and comfortable like this."," 2022 spring and summer trends that you can take part in even if you're modest. First up are baggy white tocage jeans. These are a major throwback with their super cute and their modest. This is what I'm really excited about, maxi skirts, especially when it's a set. These are going to be super popular. Lastly, the soft buttered yellow is going to be super popular. Again, it's in a courted set, but let me know or any of these trends ones that you will follow.",,," Trends you need an on so that you can have a hot girl summer. For one is a strappy pair of sandals or heels. These ones are white and go with everything. Tan pair I love and wear a lot too. And this black pair is a good option too. Two, instant cool is these sunglasses, like square shaped sunglasses. Like it instantly makes this outfit cooler. I got these on Amazon. Three, knitwear. I love this tank. I have it on right now. I have it in white. Here's the white. I wear this all the time."," Let's talk about the perpetual crusty 2016 outfits. Now, fashion is subjective at the end of the day, like beauties in the eye, the beholder. You can wear what you want. I'm talking about this, like this is kind of classic, but you know, like the crusty version, the Forever 21 type beat. Oh, a little bit of this, no matter what, the skinny jeans and the gym shoes. Now, they are a little crusty, but they can still be worked into a modern outfit. So I'm gonna start a series of modernizing 2016 outfits. And let's start with our good friend over here. What I don't like is that these fabrics look cheap, like polyester spandexy. And at the end of the day, try to eliminate logos. So, Windbreaker, I would substitute would be something like this classic color combo, even has details with the stripes. A little bit oversized, no more white shirt, to match the white here and the navy and the words. And to D2016, get rid of the leggings and exchange it with a straight leg jean. And here's the fit.",,,,
,," 2025 spring fashion trends that absolutely no one has to follow but if you like learning about it here you go Let's start with the Isabel Morat boho chic style This is tons of ruffles layers texture a lot of accessories jewelry fringe and studs. It's it's everything as far as color trends go Be prepared to be sick of pistachio green. I actually can't get enough of this I love it in clothing and shoes accessories. I will definitely be adding more pistachio brands my wardrobe But don't worry my favorite color butter yellow will also be trending how cute is it with these colors? Let a stick of butter be your style in spell for the spring final color trend that is just huge for 2025 in general Is this beautiful pastel pink not normally super into pink, but I have been Seriously crushing on this color. Basically all three of these colors are pastels, which is just perfect for spring You're gonna see tons of bag charms and just charms in general even like a bag having a bag As you can see here and like I said charms in general so that means jewelry charm bracelets necklaces Even like phone accessory charms. I love the scarf over a baseball cap trend Just adds a little extra to the Accessorizing and it looks so cool with the sunnies and all the jewelry too. This is a part one. Stay tuned for part two"," This is part five of winter 24 fashion trends. Now that we're a little bit into fall, I have a better idea of what trends are gonna be following us into the new year. The first one being socks and heels. I saw this TikTok that Paige posted yesterday and I was like, I need to do this. Here's how another creator styled them. I love the gray socks. I just ordered a pair just like these on the Amazon. Here's another variation. And I also really like it with these sheer socks, leading us into our next trend, which is sheer and lace pants. I have a pair coming in the mail from IMG that look pretty similar to this and I can't wait to style it with an oversized black blazer. I think it's such a cool look, especially for the holidays. Also these, they're just completely black sheer. And here's Shay Mitchell's, styling them with a cargo pant variation. Next is scarf coats. I think this all started when the Toe Tum Coat went viral last winter. But since then there's so many other variations. This one's from Zara. I really need to go look up at this is still available because so cute. And this one, and a new Abo Kombi has one too. Next is Burgundy. I feel like we've all been hearing red, red, red for winter. But I think Burgundy is a more like long-lasting trend we're gonna be seeing. Also not just in leather, but in full outfits like this. And in tights, I have a pair from Target that are just like this and they're so cute. Follow them more."," Fall 2024 fashion trends coming from someone who is obsessed with fall fashion. First off, if you haven't seen it yet, you're going to swayed everything, especially browns weighed. I'm looking for a browns weighed bag so badly right now. I'm obsessed with the jacket, this trench coat that's browns weighed as well. And this picture has been haunting me like all over my Pinterest. I'm going to have to track down this coat. This one may be controversial, but Hunter boots. I know we all went through that phase at least I did in like middle school before high school with a tall Hunter boots. And I really think that they're going to have a resurgence. This is a prime example of like cute, girly mixed with like the grungy Hunter boot that I love. This is a little bit more spring vibes, but like you get the point, the fun chunky sweater, maybe like striped pants, Hunter boots, but I like it more with shorts, probably than pants. This is just a personal obsession, but like the gold hair jewels. I'm obsessed with like the laid back ponytail that has this chunky gold bangle on it. Bonus points for multiple bangles, but like that just simply wouldn't work on my hair. Also, I'm all for like no key, just effortless style and this little like barrette thing that she has is perfection. I realize that this was all pretty much accessories. So I'm doing part two with the outfits."," We're gonna talk 2024 fashion trends. The runways have been seen. The miles are out. The trends are out. Let's talk about them. This is part two. Go to part one for more information. Let's get into it. And part one, I talked about how tights are huge this year. We're absolutely going to be seeing them everywhere. The lace trend with tights is going to be everywhere. It's already everywhere. It's gorgeous. It's stunning. It's been all over the runways. We're seeing tights in so many different colors and variations now. We're seeing polka dot tights come back. We're very much seeing this white tight fly. I would personally brand it when we were young because that's kind of what we're going back to. We're going back to early 2000s. Things like polka dot tights, things that we enjoyed when we were younger like the red tights. The trend of this year with denim is elevated denim. We're going to darker denim. We're making a little bit of a switch. We're going less baggy, more to straight leg. We're also incorporating elevated denim, which is looking like metallics. We're looking like taking your regular jeans and just making them a little more fascinating. The biggest denim trend for jeans this year is said to be the horseshoe jean. All baggy jeans are going out a bit. We're taking on the silhouette where it's going out in the in-quenant bit. So while we're going away from baggy, more to straight leg, this is supposed to be also one of the biggest trends this year. Very fascinating. Let me know your thoughts. My favorite denim that we're seeing is this elevated metallic denim. I'm obsessed with this trend. I think it's the cutest in the world. Seeing shiny metallics come back into style, but also this denim being metallic, this combination is so cool. It can also look like this if you're not into the super, super blue look. And one of my absolute favorite trends this year are these pants because they're metallic pants. More casual, you can dress them up, you can dress them down, you can wear them with sneakers. And the easiest way to wear this is with sneakers and just a white top. Here's another example. We're going to be seeing a lot of golden silver. This is another great example. It's a denim looking pants, but it's more cargo, more utility-wish we're going to be seeing a lot of as well. I actually own these. I love them. I get so many compliments when I wear them out. Something else I'll be seeing so much of is leopard print. I absolutely love this. I think I fell in love with the girl through rock show, Jenny Humphrey, if she was dating a guy in a band. So incredibly easy to dress up or dress down. I love it with jeans. It makes any basic outfit look so good. I think we'll be seeing more in coats and hats. Possibly handbags as well, but I think it's bucket-halle. We want one of the main ways that we see it in hats. But this beret moment is so cute as well. Here's another example. I'm going to part through for more."," the biggest trend for spring right now and I have a feeling it's gonna shock a lot of you. Capri's are making a comeback. Most every time we see this we're gonna see Capri's with kitten heels in a shirt with an elongated silhouette. Sunity makes the best pair in their under $40. In low-counts saying these are, no Zara has a lot of pairs too. It's gonna be seeing this in active wear like this and curious how all of you feel about this trend. Let me know in the comments."," I have Winter wardrobe must-have from someone who clearly loves winter fashion. First, we have one of the basics of a solid winter wardrobe, the crew next sweater. I love to have them in basic colors so they can go with all of my jackets and with all of my pants. Next, we have dark color jeans. Now, I love a pair of classic blue jeans, but for the winter, sometimes you just need that dark repair. Whether that's an indigo color like this or black, this is perfect. Number three, a pair of nice boots that are waterproof. This is my go-to when going out in the wintertime. Now, if I'm doing a long walk, obviously I'm going to wear snow boots or something similar. But if you are going out having something like this, you can wear through a bit of snow or rain is perfect. And that could be an ankle boot as well if you wear that more often. Next, number four, we have a crossbody bag. Now, you're probably asking yourself, Julia, how is a crossbody bag a winter essential? Now, if you have ever been wearing a scarf, a bulky jacket, all of your layers, and you've been trying to keep a shoulder bag on your shoulder, I can tell you it is the most annoying thing. A crossbody bag will not do that. These obviously will go over all your coats or jackets and leave you hands-free so you don't have to worry about it. And lastly, number five, we have a wool coat. I don't care how cold it is, how snowy it is, I am wearing a wool coat, not a puff or jacket. I'm not that into a closure and this just suits my style way better. So, that could be a classic jacket like this or something more in a statement color because I love a pop of color in the wintertime. I wear these all so often in the winter, so hopefully this will help you. And I've linked all of these or similar overview on LTK.", ball trends and to install them the color red is having a major malmer right now and that is definitely going to translate into Tights and I would style them like this this and this this is also very niche but gray sweaters are going to trend and I would style them like this This and this KMO is also coming back and I would style it like this this and this like for the next part," 2023 styles and trends. These are styles that I've had my own that I plan to recreate this summer. Pinterest edition did find some very similar and some exact pieces on my Amazon and you can find that on my store for it under summer fonts. Jumping into it one of my favorite and I feel like one of the easiest looks you can do just a structured short navy is my jam this summer, a navy bottom or navy top or a navy dress but navy. This like a tan beige gold champagne whatever color up top with a navy short I love this. Obsessed an all-white set I've been looking for one just like this that would come like together I found separates but I'm still on the hunt for a set so I'll let you know if I find one. Like me and you don't like a ton of your arm showing I thought about doing like one of those sheer floral tops underneath. I love this I love a summer maxi summer midi floral dress they just scream summer. I love the tie detail on the shoulder I think it's precious. More floral I'm just obsessed with floral for this season I just cannot get enough. Love the dress like the mini dress or midi with a cowboy boot coastal cowgirl here we go. I love the way this looks the monochrome white I'm very into that this season and have been for a while I love the gauzy blouse with the structured short I think she looks so cute all about whatever you call this straw crochet open weave purses but I'm here for I love this back. Spoiler alert I found this exact dress and it's on my Amazon I love the stress I love the pattern I love the colors I love the print I love everything about it you know what's really good about this dress as well first off it senses at the waist and it flares out you all already know I'm obsessed with that and it's just so flattering for everyone but it's gonna transition so good into the fall with a boot where it was a sandal in the summer and a boot in the fall love another take on the monochrome but with the brown tones I I love this in a crisscross neck I feel like that is just very flattering for anyone I just I love it I love how she has her collar buttoned all the way up I'm not going to wear green sparkle pants by any means if you want to go for it but that's not me but I would do like a black slack white slack off white slack jeans whatever but like I love how it's buttoned up and then flare so printed brows with some white structured shorts I don't know how many times I've shared it but I love it now to time that I hope that was helpful you can always find more inspiration on my Pinterest board and find everything in my Amazon storefront"," Here at the top 10, spring summer 2023 trends that you need to know brought to you by Vogue. And you can shop them all right now. First stop is pocket change, which we've all seen before, but now the cargo style is going beyond pants. We're seeing styles like this Miyu Miyu set. They took their core mini skirt and made utilitarian and added that vest and really evolving this trend. Next up is pillow talk. Re-imagined core sets. Majorius underpinnings and sheer evening gowns, like this top from Paco Reban. You can style with a silk mini skirt or even a pair of distrust jeans. Totally see this trend becoming that relaxed, cool girl summer look. Next up, or denim. Know what you're thinking? We've seen this trend season after season. But still, designers are coming through with some unique stuff. Really love this piece by J.W. Anderson. It's a unique take and lends itself to our next trend. Runs revisited. Maybe because I grew up in the 90s, but I will never get tired of grunge. I think this Miyu Miyu look really represents this new trend. Versed at like effortless, downtown energy with the layers, the loose fit and a touch of masculinity. But we all know those jewels apply to what sets me off. Shuffs kiss. I think we all know who laid the groundwork. And thanks to Batega, flannel is going to be an object of desire. And that's it for part one. Follow along for part two."," staple pieces you need in your closet for fall and winter 2021 fashion from a fashion major. Part two. Literally nothing new at all but make sure you have a good pair of black chains for fall and winter. We've been seeing a lot of baseball caps lately and I'm obsessed they can be done so many ways and are such a good staple. The knee high boot whether they're chunky like these, heels or cowboy boot everyone needs a pair. I mentioned in one of my last videos that pattern tights were going to be huge this fall whether they're super colorful a more versatile pattern like this or just solid black. I think they're a great staple piece. The trouser having a good solid color that can go with anything in your closet is a must. Again this one's literally nothing new but I think everyone needs a good French coat for fall and winter and I also love the look paired with baseball caps. Last but not least I think having a good plaid, howling's tooth or check skirt really completes any wardrobe especially with how much we're loving preppy this fall."," Top three shoes to have in your closet this fall winter, according to New York City Fashion Stars. The Deed Asambas. I don't care what color you get them in. I urge you to get a Deed Asambas. They are so cute, so comfortable. I used to be against this trend because I played soccer my whole life and I only shoes when I was like six years old, but I caved and I obsessed. Number two knee high boots. I'm sure you guys have seen these all over TikTok already. Instead of over knee, opt for a pair that are either hit right at the knee or right below. And number three, I suggest a pair of ankle sock booties. These just go with literally everything."," Spring and Summer 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major part three. Another unexpected and kind of controversial one, clogs. We're especially seeing these Birkenstock clogs. Cannot lie at first I was not about it but I think this is cute. These two. We've been so used to small bags and shoulder bags but we're starting to see much larger bags. And bigger back packs, bigger tote bags, which lucky for us is great for practicality. We're also seeing a lot of really chunky heavy knitwear or heavy crochet, like just imagine all of the color combos for Spring and Summer. We're also seeing a lot of body chains or body jewelry, especially worn on top of clothing. This one's a little extra but I think it's so beautiful. It's giving this and and lots of keyhole cutouts like this or this like for part four."," Okay, I don't know if I'm the only one, but I am extremely sick of winter fashion, extremely. And because of this, I found a trend by scrolling on Pinterest, Zara, that I think is gonna be big in spring. I'm trying to cover it, but it's Peter Pan color tops. Here's another picture I found stunning. If you love that, love Shaq Fancy vibe, this is it for you. Here's it on Zara's website, they have so many more. Another vibe. Basically, I'm saying I just been seeing it like a low key everywhere, so I wanna know people's opinion because they feel like you can either love it or hate it. So I love it, do you hate it?",,,,,,,,
,," T-shirts will see more of this year. Obviously, loafers will be back. And we will especially see them styled with fun socks. Lifers are also really paving the way to boat shoes. This makes the Eritzia Sparic Lab really exciting and they are almost sold out. We are also going to see a lot of mules especially in this material. These are definitely having a comeback. We are also going to see a lot of calprent. Sporty shoes are definitely going to have a moment. I think we will see a lot of these. And these, I really think this color is going to trend when it's available. I like for the next part."," Let's talk about winter 2024 fashion and what I'm excited to wear this winter via my Pinterest board. I think this winter season we're really going to see people going all in with mixing and matching textures. I just think it's a perfect time for that because you can bundle up, you can wear as much as you want, you still want to be cozy. So you'll see a variety of textures, whether that's mohair, whether that's wool, whether that's satin, whether that's fur, whether it's ruffles, suede, all these different things and combining them. You can see three examples here, here and here. I think all these outfits look so looks so chic. I think it adds so much interest when you just combine all these different textures and it just looks so tasteful. I love it. The next big thing I'm really looking forward to seeing and doing is chunky jewelry and not just chunky jewelry, but chunky hair accessories. I think in the winter you tend to wear these really big chunky things, but then indoors you start to get hot. So having your hair up is always nice and just imagine having this gorgeous hair piece in your hair or just a really statement clip or anything like that. I think that is such a fun touch to an outfit it's kind of unexpected. Of course you guys know I love a chunky earring, especially with like a turtleneck. I think it just looks so good. Another thing I've been loving is like really chunky bangles going over the top of your long sleeves. This is another way to add interesting texture because it can kind of cinch the area and create a beautiful silhouette on your sleeves as well. So that is something else I'm loving. Of course a classic for the winter is just having a staple go to chunky scarf if you do not already have one. I honestly would purchase one. I have a bright blue one and I love it. I think it just adds such a fun pop to any outfit and it's just a really easy way to elevate your look and stay nice and warm and cozy. And it's also one of those like pieces that you can easily take on and off if you're getting too hot. So I love that about a chunky scarf. You right here is another very interesting hair piece. I absolutely love that one. I really want it. I don't know if it would look good in my hair but like my soul is telling me get it. Again here we can see a lot of texture in this outfit. What I love about an outfit like this is like on one hand it kind of looks like she just threw it together and just put all these random things together. But like at the same time it's almost like this monochromatic look with all these interesting fun textures and silhouettes and I just love it especially the like wool and mittens. She's just clearly very cozy, very casual but chic at the same time. I absolutely love this. I also love a monochromatic moment in general. I love it's hertleneck. It's not for everyone. So this next one might be kind of a controversial opinion depending on how you feel about turtleneck. But to me it ultra ultra high rise turtleneck is so freaking chic. It's so beautiful. It's so cozy. Now if you're kind of you know have issues with like over sensation and just you know you over stimulated this might not be for you but if you could handle it. Oh my gosh I think wearing this type of look is just so freaking chic and you can just slick back your hair throwing a chunky earring chunky hair accessory and it is perfect. Another thing that I'm really excited to delve into for the winter and again going to be a controversial one but it's fur. Now I am by no means telling you to go by new fur. Because I think those are both poor options but going to the thrift store and if you want to buy faux fur you can do that but honestly getting vintage or thrifted real fur. That's a steal. That is a deal. That is the thing to do. Okay. That is probably the most sustainable option and it just looks so chic. Another thing I love about this outfit up here is that very sparkly metallic bag that is another thing that I will get into. See kind of my sparkly ideas coming up over there but real quick before we dive into that here's another very high neck, very chic little turtleneck. I love it. Another thing that I've been loving is just like tastefully sheer tops. I think they just make an outfit so like almost sexy. It's like revealing but also not. I love it. That was a big go-to for me. I have this one like very deep red cranberry sheer top and I just think it's so sexy without like revealing much at all. I think it's just great. And then finally now actually moving into this whole metallic sparkly train. It is December, January, timeframe right now. Okay you guys it is time for the holidays. It is time to enjoy even after the holidays. If you want to go out with your girls and get a drink where something sparkly? This is on a posh mark right now if you're interested but I just think this metallic look. I love it. I love it. I love silver. I know silver is like a big thing right now but honestly when it comes to the metallic I love seeing just interesting metallic colors like greens, pinks and gold. I love a gold metallic piece. I really want gold metallic pants but like it's so hard to do them right. So that is definitely a wish list item but I would love to see it more metallic. I don't know that we're going to necessarily because I don't know that it's like a super huge trending thing but like personally for me I love it. And then kind of same realm up here is just like a sparkly look to me these outfits right here giving like we're going to a holiday bar and we want to be cute and festive but like we're not doing like too much but we're still like bringing the glitz and the glam. So that is everything that I'm excited to wear this winter. Let me know what y'all are excited to wear. If there's any trends that I missed these are just the ones that I personally am excited about. Don't even know if they're actually trends but that is just my two cents and that is my winter 2024 Pinterest board and yeah I hope you enjoyed and I'll talk to you guys later."," 2024 fashion trends from you'll literally never guess a fashion major. Part three. First up, we have a lot of 50s inspired pieces or looks like this, this, or this. This was one of my favorite looks from Copenhagen Fashion Week. So was this one? I feel like cute little matching sets like this are always in for fall and a lot of the sets are cohorts. I'm seeing this year. Have a lot of that vintage play. This silhouette especially is super hot this season both in tops and in dresses. And it definitely draws a lot of inspiration from this silhouette that was huge in the 50s. Although this one is a bit less direct, I'm seeing a lot of these full length button fests tops and a lot of these super chunky cardigans button up to be worn as a sweater. Especially with the bigger chunkier almost statement like buttons or really just any cardigan worn as a sweater. Like this, this, or this. Same thing goes for short sleeves. And of course a lot with only this hot button button. Next up is actually one of my favorites knee-linked skirts like this or this. But do not worry, midi or maxi skirts are not going anywhere. I'm seeing a lot of pleated midi or maxi skirts. I think this is going to be such an at skirt for fall like this, this, or this. And overall a lot of structured fuller midi and maxi skirts. Some with a lot of movement or seemingly heavier or stiffer fabric. Like this and a lot with plaid. I think it's so cute like for part four."," Sixth trend to know for 2024 coming out of New York Fashion Week. Our entire editorial team is talking about this right now. Pedal pushers are back and one styled correctly. I really don't mind them. We saw everyone go crazy over the botega drop earrings this year and big chunky earrings are definitely set to continue trending in 2024. Boes and essentially every shape, size and iteration will continue to have a moment. Sheer fabrics aren't going anywhere. We're starting to see them paired with wardrobe basics like blazers and sweaters. We'll see a continuation of the minimalistic dressing we saw through the lens of quiet luxury this year. And we expect to see netted fabrics as well. Even if these trends don't look super wearable, at first glance on the runways, more practical options are already trickling onto the market. You can find more on the trends at the link in our bio."," Let's talk spring 2024 fashion trend. Runways have happened and are currently happening. So let's talk about all the trends that we're gonna be seeing this spring and summer. If you like spring is always overlooked, but I feel like it's gonna be so good this year. I am so excited. Let's get into it. First things first, florals, of course, it's spring, but you guys, it's so different this year. Florals and specifically roses are being literally made into the structure and the construction of these pieces. It's crazy. We saw looks like this, this, and this, though it's gonna be everywhere. I think this all started with a Valentino rose skirt because this blew up, it took over. It's absolutely huge and crazy. Now we're seeing it being brought into so many different styles for everyday use, which is like kind of a big deal for fashion because it's a little more new for street style. It's also day-to-day outfits. Obviously, it doesn't have to be that crazy or wild, but something like this is a little more wearable. Or even this, this is my personal favorite. I think it's so cute, the skirt, the top. Here's another example of how it's absolutely everywhere. Overalls and the hidden apron is said to be huge this year. I think this is very, very fascinating. Here's an example of what the hidden apron looks like. Personally, I think this is really, really cute. And I love overalls also for spring and summer. The fantastic example of how it can be very, very wearable. Next up is denim. We know that denim has been having its moment, but it's even crazier. It's blowing up, it's getting even bigger. We saw it all over the runways in so many different styles. I think we're gonna be seeing it a lot of sets like this. Continuation on the best trend, which we'll talk about in a second like this. Another very cute example of how it's very wearable. But denim is just absolutely killing it, whether it's a top, a set, a bottom, a skirt. We know the max, a skirt was huge, but also let's talk about shoes. We're gonna be seeing it so much in shoes, especially shoes like this. Slingbacks like this, which are gorgeous stunning. And this because it's a perfect shoe for spring, the combination of it is impeccable. And on the topic of shoes, of course, a huge trend for shoes this year is going to be a continuation of the slingback. It's such an easy shoe to style. I think it's great for everyone. Finally, it's just a normal win, something we can wear just straight out the runway. Like I said, we'll see the combination of denim and a slingback, but also so many kinds of mules. This is so gorgeous. This shoe is going to be huge this year. I've personally already seen this shoe absolutely everywhere. I love it. I think it's so cute. It's very, very easy mule to wear. And again, a moment in denim. Mules are huge as well as these mule wedge platform shoes. This for spring is stunning. So cute. Huge as they're everywhere. I love that. I think they're kind of coming from this preppy loafer situation with a wedge. Don't love these, but I get it. There's so much more to cover. Stay tuned for part two."," Last stop, Winter Fashion Trends. These extremely puffy puffer jackets are definitely gonna be trending this winter, especially in some fun colors like this red, this, this green, and also this brown. Another thing that is definitely gonna be trending this winter, these super long scarves. Some people talking about skinny scarves, but skinny scarves are definitely for fall for winter we're gonna be seeing these super long ones. We're talking about almost touching the floor kind of vibe. Other things that is gonna be quite big this winter are these any-lang jackets with some really big fur. Something like this, this, or like these charter ones from Charlottesima. Another thing that is gonna be super big this winter is the Cheetah print. We've been seeing them in coats, also bags, hats, and so it goes. Another big thing this winter is gonna be fun hats, like this fluffy cowboy one from Emma Brewing. I mean, look at this. Also some played ones in different colors. Basically something to add some fun to our boring winter outfits. I mean, know your thoughts on these trends and follow for part two."," introduce you to top 5 fall 2023 fashion trends. Number one red color, the ultimate color of this season. Not feeling like dressing in red head to toe, not to worry. Just add some little accessories to your outfits, like a red scarf, red bag, some shoes, or even socks and nail polish. Number two leather. Fall, we tend to wear very soft fabrics like wool and cashmere. Adding leather fabric to your outfits will elevate them significantly. My personal favorite outfit formula for the fall is leather pants plus wall or cashmere sweater. Number three long dramatic coats. Long coats always look so chic and beautiful. They work perfectly with all the outfits. Plus they work amazingly if you want to elongate your silhouette. Number four sandals plus socks. You can match the sandals with simple cotton rib socks or silk socks. You can choose same color or go for some fun accent bright color. Number five fun skirts plus simple top. If you have some fun printed skirt in your wardrobe but don't know how to style it, follow this tip. Match such skirt with a simple cashmere sweater or even a sweatshirt. If you're still struggling with adding trended pieces to your wardrobe, book a consultation with me and you will get the fall trend guide for free."," summer 2023 styles and trends. Things that I've pinned on Pinterest that I can't wait to recreate this summer. Also, yes, before someone points it out, I was crying this morning, I dropped my set off at school for the first time today and yeah, let's just get past that. First outfit, I'm absolutely obsessed. I love neutrals and I just love the style of these pants and this blouse, just matching sets are still all the right to the season. Something about this photo just screams summer to me. I love this style swimsuit with the Underwire Cup swimsuit top. I think it is a very flattering bikini style and I can't wait to get my hands on one to recreate plus the bucket hat is so cute. Not sure if I'll be doing the bucket hat, but it is very entrant and I love to see it on people. Other swimsuit, I just love this print, floral, floral, floral colors. I like the cut of this. I just love everything about it. Maxi dresses are in full force, they are everywhere and in every color, shape, shade, print, whatever it is, they're everywhere and I am personally obsessed with this blue and white one. I think it is stunning. More proof that Maxi dresses are everywhere. I love this gingham print one, the ruffle sleeve is all the right as well with the smart top. You all know how I feel about that. I think it is a very flattering fit when it comes to Maxi dresses. One before this would not be as flattering on someone with a bigger chest. This one would be more flattering because it's going to come in under the bus and then flare out versus just coming out at your bus and flowing down. This gives you more of a shape. So kind of keep that in mind when you're looking to do the Maxi dress trend. Vests and denim, it's all talked about vest and matching pants, but the vest and denim, I am actually really here for this and kind of like it more than the matching set to be honest. I like the change up of color with the denim and the vest and I just, I think she looks so good and this is going to transition so well into the fall just like a mock neck long sleeve, some sort under it or a deeper colored floral blouse. Like I just, I can see so many things, a silk blouse under, there's so many options with the vest and I think everyone, if you want to be on trend, should have a vest in your closet. Violet is everywhere and I'm personally obsessed with this one and I'm very tempted to order it off of Pinterest. I love the way it looks, it's very breathable for summer, very flowy, very feminine and chic and I just, I love it. Knits and silks are also very on trend right now and I love the way they look paired together, dressed up, dressed down, I love it. I hope that was helpful, like and follow for more.", 23 things you need for spring 23 part two number six of the Bergenstock Boston clogs is it been popular for several seasons now but i'm gonna continue wearing mine in the spring number seven is a denim jacket i'm really into like more of a shacket style and a darker washed denim jacket and i love this one each and it number eight is just a good white button down love the tomboy shirt from sezon it's a very versatile and you can wear it year round number nine is a pair of overalls i really like this black pair but you could also do like a blue or white pair of overalls i always like to add one like feminine frilly blouse to my closet in the spring and this is my pick this year still have 13 items left so let me know if you guys want to see a part three," If you want to jump start on the winter fashion trends, you're gonna want to try these three items next month. Okay, first up, the leather blazer. I've been rocking this actually for the last few weeks and I'm obsessed. So you could try a fitted version like this, a baggy or version like this, or you could do a crop version like this. All right, next up, throwing it back to the 80s with the like warmers. All right, the celebrities have been rocking these in the past month or so and I actually think it looks really cute like this. How cooler are these leather ones? I love these. For just a plain black pair like these. Last up, the white button down shirts which we've been seeing all over the place this fall. They're sticking around but there's also an upgrade to them. So you could always do the classic one like this or you could try a cropped version like this, an extra cropped version like this, or a one piece dress version like this."," trends that are going to be popular this fall. Animal prints all the rage again this fall, but not just pants. I'm going to see more animal print jackets, any skirts, axi skirts, and even vest. Lots of denim on denim, like full denim outfits. Denim dresses, especially in this darker color which I absolutely love. It might be time for me to ditch all my shorter boots and embrace a tall boot fall. I'm loving a brown biker boot, simple tall black boot, or a western boot. This burgundy is definitely going to be the color of the season, especially for accessories or jackets and shoes. Let me know if you want a part too."," 2022 spring and summer trends that you can take part in even if you're modest. First up are baggy white tocage jeans. These are a major throwback with their super cute and their modest. This is what I'm really excited about, maxi skirts, especially when it's a set. These are going to be super popular. Lastly, the soft buttered yellow is going to be super popular. Again, it's in a courted set, but let me know or any of these trends ones that you will follow."," These are my 2022 spring fashion predictions. First up, love it or hate it and that is mesh. Now believe it or not, I know there are 10 of us that love mesh. There are some that don't, but unfortunately, it has stuck around for quite a few seasons. Fortunately for us who love it, it is going to make it to spring. I think we're gonna see a lot of fun prints, colors. I also think these arm warmer tops aren't going anywhere as well. We're gonna take them right into spring and believe it or not, depending on the fabric, I think they'll come with us to summer as well. What do you think about this? Next up are these really like trendy printed pieces. Now this is like a newspaper print. I see this being really huge, retro prints of course, checkered, anything that's gonna have some type of pattern to it. I think it's gonna take us right into spring and it's gonna be super popular and it dresses up your fit, so I'm here for it. Next up are mini skirts, but not just a short skirt. I'm talking about a mini skirt the way you see here. Now this really isn't my cup of tea, but I feel like it's what's coming back. I see it's very Y2K driven. Now this is actually really short. I'm sure somebody will wear this and rock it, but I feel like I would partake if it was a little bit longer. That's just me. You can do it with pantyhose without pantyhose, whatever you prefer, but the mini skirt is back. Core sets here to stay, they've been here and they're not going anywhere this spring and probably summer. Those of you that love this will say that it never left, but I'm gonna say animal print. I see animal print coming back in a huge way this spring and summer. Again, it's never left, but I think it's gonna be really trendy, especially like zebra print, leopard print. I'm already seeing it everywhere and yeah, it's back. And last but not least is the wedge, but not your typical wedge. I think we're gonna do like a statement kind of funky wedge the way you see here.",,,,,,,,
,, trip to UK in May with a low budget. I got you. What cool girls be wearing for a spring trip in 2025? Packed that barn jacket and if you don't have one of these honestly go with any jacket but these are very very affordable. Can go with so many things especially good for a really casual look. We all have our favorite t-shirt and jeans and this would just be a good layering item since it's still kind of cooler in May. We can go with a more oversized style or if you have a cropped one just zip it up honestly put it with some jeans and a cute pair of loafers. Really can't go wrong and you can always take this off if needed. Pack your favorite white tee personally. I love a good oversized white tee. Pairs so nicely with jeans you could pair it with a cute pair of heels depending on how much walking you're doing. There's just something so effortless about a style a t-shirt like this or even a look like this is really nice with a less oversized tee with some trousers and some sandals or if you find yourself having some warmer days pair it with your favorite mini skirt. Suit sets. Sets are so nice because you get a lot with one purchase or with a very spring color kind of like this or even a bright pink would be really cute or something like this more of a classic color and if you do have a blazer I would pack it honestly because you can wear it with the set or separately and this type of style is pair so well with sneakers which I know we are wearing a lot of sneakers on trips. You just really can't go wrong. Sat in pants I'm telling you this can be paired with just so many things pair so nicely with tank tops. I'm pack one of your favorite light sweaters and kind of do a look like this as well. Again you're utilizing that oversized white tee that you're packing. So you're really saving up space and saving money. Another really great example utilizing other things that you're already packing like a white oversized tee I'm sure you'll pack out least one pair of sandals and I am partial to the cream set in pants but you could also go with something like this more of a green. You can be a cue on your trip while utilizing what you already have in your closet have fun on your trip.," Hello friends, I'm back with a part two of winter 2024 fashion trends. If you haven't checked out my first video, please check it out. This one we're gonna do the same. We're gonna chat about some current styles that you should be expecting for the winter season. The styles I'm loving kind of my opinions, so let's chat. For those who don't know me, my name is Megan and I own an online boutique for women called Muse and Made in boutique. If you haven't checked it out, please do. Okay, I'm sure you guys have seen the trench coat a lot. The trench coat is just a classic. I love this one in particular. I love how it's kind of a little bit oversized as you to layer pieces underneath, which we all need for the winter because it gets freezing. I love how the belt really like elevates the look. I love how that accentuates the waist. It gives your body just that really like gorgeous silhouette and still allows you to be like comfy and warm and snugly. I give this a 10 out of 10. Here is another example of the trench coat that I'm loving. I love the length of this coat. I love how long it is. And just this whole look is very chic, very elevated and yet casual. Notice the uggs. Okay, can we appreciate the uggs? This look is just fabulous in every way. Right, I'm sure you guys have seen a lot of this like rhinestone crystal type vibe for the holidays. I feel like this look is perfection. It's hitting all the trends here. You have the oversized kind of bomber leather jacket, which is always in trend for winter. You have the metallic accessory bag, which is like perfect. Maxi skirt that offers like a little peek of a moment. It's a little bit sheer, but still really chic and classy. And then of course, like the leather bando. I love this look. I think that it's so fun. It's a way to just elevate your holiday style and kind of look like the cool girl at the party, you know. And then I had to include this oversized bomber leather jacket moment as well. Can we appreciate just the like masculinity kind of of the jacket, but then you have that really feminine silk slip dress. Like I would never think to put this together, but it is so pretty. And I'm loving this for the holiday. What do you guys think? And then the tried and true long oversized cardigan. I love the tones of the sweater. Just that rich like brown and black. And it's just so flattering. It's comfy. And I think long cardigans are the way to go this winter. I am on the hunt for the perfect long cardigans for the boutique. So stay tuned for that. All right, you guys. That is it for this part two. What do you guys think? Did you like these styles? These might be some of my favorite that I've seen so far. I'm definitely going to try to rock one of these looks for the winter season. And I can't wait. You guys were watching and do we need a part three? Let me know in the comments."," What cool girls will be wearing for fall 2024? Part four. Track pants. Specifically styled on the more dressy side, like with a blazer or some heels. Love this track pant paired with the socks and Mary Jane's. Don't be afraid to go really colorful with your track pant. You could also go more casual with it, dress it with some sneakers and a fur coat. Suede is back, specifically we're going to be seeing a lot of suede jackets. Particularly, love suede with a trench jacket. It just makes such a statement. I need to recreate this studded suede jacket immediately. Also, be seeing lots of suede bags. And if you like suede, but you want something a little less obvious, I'd go for a suede boot. Mix matched denim on denim. Really love this mixed matched look with the pop of red. It's a little bit more fun to a denim on denim look. Really like a denim button down with a baggy jean. And honestly, this is trying to so easy to recreate. Lace maxi skirts. Gonna be seeing a lot of baggy on baggy looks. Looks so good with an oversized button down. Pair it with your favorite fall boots and oversized sweater. Or with an oversized blazer, what a beautiful combo."," 2024 trend predictions from a fashion journalist. A pop of red is gonna be super in. We've already seen this in 2023, but it's gonna continue in 2024. It's just such an easy way to elevate an outfit, but if you wanna keep it more timeless, burgundy slash oxblood is super in, like it's all over the runways. Now Slim trousers will be in in 2024. And I said Slim, not skinny. Baggy trousers have had that era and fashion is cyclical. But be prepared for a narrowing of the pant. Cheetah slash leopard print is gonna be huge. It's she, sexy, and it's easy to thrift. Leopard print never really goes out of style, but indie sleaze is making a major comeback this year, and this will be a staple of it. Rugby shirts will be hot as well. 2023 had like the old money obsession, but also loved a football shirt. The rugby shirt is a marriage of the two, and it's already been spotted on a runway. This is also very British indie sleaze revival. Finally, the it-brand of 2024 will be Ferragamo. They've got an incredible new creative director, and every celeb has been loving new Ferragamo, and the accessories are amazing."," Spring trend predictions is why I think the cool girls will be wearing. Boxer shorts are gonna be a huge thing We very started to see them. Especially this outfit specifically looks so like cute and comfy, but still put together This is like a great way to style it. It's like a good going out running errands outfit I love it style like this with like a jacket tall boots and a little graphic tea Speaking of graphic teas, I think we're gonna see a lot more graphic baby teas like stuff like this You know easy to pair with a casual outfit or just like a going out top Sure, it's like this are perfect. It's like simple and artsy and then you can just wear this with jeans and some jewelry layered on top for shoes Mary jeans are having a moment I personally like them better than the ballet flats. They're also trending right now And I really like them like with a kitten heel like this pair It's so cute and I think it really like elevates an outfit also like the styling with the socks I really love the style where it has like a bunch of buckles like this. I think it makes the outfit like a little more edgy than just like girly I really love the way this is styled with the color blocking like the top and the dress kind of match the socks with the shoes It's so cute. This is a very specific item, but striped light blue button-ups I've been seeing girl style it as like a casual outfit or like more going out like dinner outfit like this I really like it in this silhouette where it's like very baggy baggy jeans and then just like this loose Half-button to look. I think this could be a staple item that you can carry through your wardrobe for like many years This doesn't really go like out of style It's also a great transition piece between winter and spring Because on chiller days you can style it like this layered like under a jacket and it looks so chic","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," Fall fashion trends from a fashion stylist. Apparently people just don't want to get dressed anymore because she's still trending. This includes almost entirely sheer or subtle sheer like this. This trend kind of kills me to talk about because I'm not a polka dot fan. But polka dots were all over the runway for fall 23. There was a classic black with white polka dots. There was a classic white with black polka dots. And then there's also colored polka dots. Safe to say if you are a polka dot person, this is your time to shine."," Okay, so we're officially in 2023, which means we are prepping for spring summer 2023. We're gonna look hot That's the motto, I guess I'm gonna give you the top trends that you need to look for what's sticking around and what you need to add your closet First up is cargo bands if you didn't add this in your closet You need it cargo pockets on literally everything more pockets jacket and pants You quite literally cannot get more cargo than this just accept it.

So let's chat about five items and fashion trends that I've cannot wait to style into the spring months. Okay, number one, I got this amazing new bag. It's a dupe for the botega bag, but it's really oversized and just super chic. And I am obsessed with the color for spring. Okay, number two, another sweater to add to the collection, but I really love the way this one fits. It's like a great oversized fit. So nice when we don't need a jacket on. I found this one at Mango. I love the little zipper and I just love this style. This is just kind of my vibe into the spring months. Okay, another purse. I actually just found this one at H&M. It was literally $34. And I feel like it was an amazing steal because it really looks like the Fendi purse, but love the color. And I think this is just gonna be a perfect addition to any outfit in the spring. Number four, I got some new Adidas running shoes. I love their new boost collection. And this is just a really fun color code for the spring. I also love going on walks and runs, especially as the weather gets warmer. So these are the perfect addition to my spring collection. I know Floral's for spring, groundbreaking. I'm obsessed with this new for Leaven Lemons collection. There really are so many cute statement pieces. And I just love a fresh start for spring. Which trend was your favorite?"," I like to style long skirts and winter, which is one of the biggest trends this season. Honestly, I love this trend because it goes perfect with your regular sweaters and nits. So if you don't have a long skirt and you like this look, I think it's definitely worth to invest in. I love them paired with heel boots or chunky boots. If you go with a chunky boot, I would definitely go with something chunky on top to balance out your proportions. So like this, this, or this. I would also suggest a tonal look to elongate your figure. And it also just looks very classy. Lastly, try to combine different textures, especially with a tonal look to make your outfit look more interesting."," trends and to style them. Athletic shorts are really trending right now not just for sports and I would style them like this, this and this. We're also gonna see a ton of red everywhere. It's one of my favorite colors so I'm so on board and I would style it like this, this and this. We've talked about this before but mesh flats are going to be everywhere and I would style them like this, this and this. Honorable mention for this one, like for the next part."," Bring in summer 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major. Part seven. First up, a very specific combo, but we're gonna be seeing a lot of corset top and micro skirt matching sets. I am so, so obsessed with them. Like, continuing with sets, we're gonna see a lot of matching three piece sets, like this, this, and lots of cardigan or button up two piece sets like this and this. Next up, one of the best is the shimmery disco material, especially in pants I just love everything about this. Like these or these or these. Not just in pants though, I think we'll be seeing it in top to as well. And I especially think we'll be seeing it combined a lot with mesh like this. Next up is boxer shorts, but make it fashion. I actually really like these and I think it's great for long wear. Like for part eight."," spring trends that are actually staples. Thraftless tops can actually be a really great closet staple. They're really trendy right now, but if you pick a more classic fabric, you'll be able to wear them for years. Elevated basic, everyone's talking about them right now. Hello, basics is in the night. These have staying power. Baseball caps are really having a moment right now. For me, it's definitely a staple. Unless you wash your hair every day, I'm sure it is for you too. So glad trousers are trending right now. Obviously, so chic and there are so many ways you can style because I live in the South, I have to say cowboy boots are a staple. Like for the next part.",,,,,,,,
,," There's just some 2025 trends that have not been said yet. Let's get into it. Little flat hair clips. I feel like they're starting to get more and more popular, but I honestly haven't really seen very many brands come out with the hair clips. Like I feel like the mainstream stores haven't caught on to this yet, or at least they aren't being implemented into the stores just yet, but I feel like this book is so chic and it's like an up-level from the clock lip. So that's to come. This one is so vague, but the color blue being used as a neutral, and the reason I think this is because I originally saw the scupperily, I think that's how you say the brand scupperily? I never know. That brand did a runway show where the entire backdrop is blue. It's like these two right here, and I loved the show, as well as I felt like a lot of the pieces were like nautical-ish-inspired. Like this outfit right here is very much on a boat. Miss Sailor, you know what I mean? Like that's what I'm getting. Not Miss Sailor. Miss Captain, that's the word. And I just feel like down here, you can see it's just like being used as a neutral. Like yes, denim is always a neutral, but I feel like the actual color in other pieces. And I think this also will be playing into like style in homes and style in other areas, not just fashion. This one I'm so excited about. I love earrings, and I think that statement earrings are going to be really big, let me move myself over here so you can see this one. But I feel like statement earrings are going to be really, really big this year, like keeping it very minimalistic on the jewelry, very simple, ring, very simple bracelets or necklace, or even none of that, and just one big statement earring. I think it makes the entire outfit look so much more unique and cool and pretty, and it like draws such a beautiful attention to your face. Like it automatically makes you like, you know? Lip gloss. I feel like lip gloss. I made these to other people. They're going to be like, lip gloss has always been in. What are you talking about? But I feel like there was a big thing for matte colored and natural looking lips over the past like three years I want to say. And I feel like lip gloss, like thick looking, wet looking lips is going to be really in. This image doesn't even grasp what I'm talking about. This still is too like light of an application. I really mean like a thick layer of lip gloss. I think that's going to be popular. And this last one is actually something that Delaney Child mentioned in her YouTube video. So 10th grade has been said before. But I'm stealing it because I do think it's a really cool idea, and that is matching, like matching with your friends, with your partner. And it's not necessarily wearing the exact same outfits, but it's just like coordinating, like looking like a solid unit. Like look at this outfit right here. They just look like good together. They match this outfit up here. They're different colors, but they go well together. And I think it's like just asking people, what are you wearing so that you guys can coordinate? Those are my takes for 2025."," attainable yet affordable holiday fashion trends. We're seeing a ton of patterned and colored tits. Check out this pair from Eritzia and this pair from Eritzia as well perfect for under your dresses or skirts. Seekwin continues to be a hot trend this holiday season, but let's be a little bit more practical with our choices. Check out this suit set from Zara what I love about this is I can wear it separately as well to bring you into 2025. If you want to tone it down but still want to pop try a sequined skirt and throw a blaser over it with some heels. We know the power of a little black dress, but let's switch it up a little bit with different patterns and materials. Check out this dress from Dynamite perfect for the holiday season. But we still got to keep warm, ditch the parka and grab a faux fur coat that's just perfect for over your dresses or skirts and keeping warm as you head over to your holiday parties. Follow for more!"," big fashion in for the shears cardigans, but done very specifically. Cardigans are always going to have to have one button or fully done up. This like buttoning at the bottom is also okay. We're not doing this. We're not like keeping it open. In my opinion, the ones from season on perfect for this. Like they are cool girl chic. I'm showing the same one, but they have so many different colors and I'm obsessed. I have them in two colors right now and I want like a bright color. Anyways, that is cardigans. We know what you think."," I am separating the trend predictions into two videos because the last video I made was outrageous, quirky, full of life and artistic. This video is for my girlies who are classic, a little bit more reserved and timeless. I mentioned in my last video that the trends are a little bit juxtaposing and that's because on the flip side of what's trending there is also a trend called quiet luxury and quiet luxury is all about having really great quality pieces that you love and that fit you beautifully. When I say quiet luxury that doesn't mean that you're dripping in brands, you're spending thousands on your clothes, you just have to choose items which are good quality and fit you really well. We are seeing lots of layering, layering and modest dressing is also huge for 2024. Something that I love doing with my clients is dressing them using different textures, different textures in their clothing with fabrics, with the way that they're cut, the way that they're made. Like this."," These are the spring 2024 fashion trends and Vogue agrees with me. The color of the season is blue in particular, frosty blue or pastel blue. I took a trick to Zara to take a look and there was lots of blue as expected. If you want to go for a more edgy look, mix blue with black and of course it can be a blue denim just like this here. If you want to be more feminine and subtle, mix blue with beige like this beautiful ensemble and if you want to be more creative and out there mix blue with red house stunning. But the main trend for this spring is texture, fabric and movement. Different textures are everywhere. Blue is most definitely the color of the season however white and cream are also going to be huge. Dresses in particular, white and cream dresses are going to be all of the hype and getting those different textures and fabrics through. Sheer fabrics are also going to be huge just like this dress here. Details are key this spring. We're seeing a lot of ruffled detail but not ugly ruffled detail. Cute ruffled detail like this and when I went to Zara today of course I saw it like that. Interesting detail like the straps up here. We can see in the stitching in this jumper here from Zara today and here again with the beaded straps. Rose details but not like this like this instead. More detailed, more defined. Big chunky statement pieces of jewelry, stacked bracelets, interesting shapes. It's almost like an art piece. We're seeing this movement again movement with the outfit is key. Comment below if you want me to create a male fashion trends video for 2024."," There are five of the biggest winter trends that's going to be everywhere in 2022. Ranked from which ones that I like the least to the ones that I like the best. Starting with number five on my list, which are long-temmed skirts and dresses. Maxi skirts and dresses with boots was all the hype this fall. And I'm pretty sure they're gonna follow us throughout whole winter and even up until spring. Next up we have the Western trend, which has been all over the runways, all of our social media, even on the streets. So I think this is a trend that's really here to stay for a while. So we're talking cowboy boots and leather and fringe mostly. Third on my list we have corsets, which is really like a revived trend from last year, I would say. Second on my list we have oversized. So oversized blazers, coats, and jeans are like the main things I would say. I love this trend because it's been here for a while, it's gonna be worth investing in, and I also personally really like the look. But on top of my list I have to say that my favorite trend of season is leather. I just think all pieces in leather look so good from pants, to bags, to shoes, to tops. Leather is just the perfect piece to elevate any outfit."," It's hot outside. I'm sweating, you're sweating. And what is the fashion industry want to talk about? All of fashion. Sweaters warn as scarves. Typically, we just see them thrown over the shoulder, not styled in any certain way. Here, you can see that one arm is thrown over the shoulder, so it's actually more scarf like and actually keeps your neck warm. Here's a better look at it. Last fall, it was all about the faded chocolate brown bomber jackets. But next fall, it's all about the color leather jackets like this. And like this."," Here are some of the hottest summer trends you'll see in Europe this year. First off is this really beautiful sequined age skirt. It comes in a ray of colors. It's just really cool just to add a little bit of pop to your outfit. Here it is in like a flurro color. So you can see depending on the color of the skirt you choose, you can really wear it throughout the day or out for dinner at night. Next up is this really stunning Camilla Cafetown. We haven't seen a lot of them. So you'd be a really early adopter if you were sort of sporting this in Europe. I luckily got my hands on one and had one here in this picture in Croatia and like a really beautiful pink. This is actually a jumpsuit so it's just really easy to wear. It also comes in a Maxi Cafetown as well if that's more your style. So next up we have this Gladiator Slide which goes all the way up to the knee. It's just super flattering. You can wear it with some shorts, skirt, dress. It's just the versatility is endless. Quite expensive so if you are going to do it, I'd probably do it in the black just because it could go with everything. So if you want to be really ahead of the curve this summer, I'd suggest this Realisation Padres. It's this really nice red, I don't wear a lot of red, but it's such a standout pretty dress. Again, it's barely been seen. You'd really be seen as like a trend set at Yit Gour if you were seeing wearing this. Stuff I'm going to move into more of the accessories arena, but this really stunning drop out necklace. It's just a real statement piece and it goes with everything. It's been styled so beautifully here just with an all black fit. If you're in a bit of a lazy mood and you can't be bothered to pull a look, this is where the owl would really come in handy. There we have it, some of the hottest trends we'll be seeing in Europe. Let me know your thoughts, let me know what you think. Okay, bye.", are 23 things you need for spring 2023 part one. First up is a really good fitting pair of jeans. This Agoody style is my favorite. I like a little bit of a baguille look. Second is a pair of cargo pants. I just got these they're really cute and really comfortable. But I also love this pair from Paxon. Third is a gray ribbed tee. I have one from Old Navy that I love but it's low in stock. This one from Target is really similar and it gives like a ritzi of IBS. Fourth is a matching set. I really like this one because it comes in a lot of different colors and can be styled so many different ways. I also love that it's short sleeves so I feel like you could really wear it year round and just say I wear it when it's cold. And fifth is a cardigan. Recently got this one from Amazon and it is my favorite cardigan I've ever owned. The fit and the quality are really good. I have 18 more items on my list so let me know if you guys want to see a part two.," It's freezing out, but you want to look cute. This is what you're going to wear. First, get yourself police like leggings. I'm already hot. Now we're going to layer. Get a thin warm top, like the Uniclo one. This one's cashmere. Layer cute turluck on top. Fixed socks. These are wool and cashmere. And the white light warmers to keep your legs warm. My favorite part of the outfit. These are like insulated, but I guess so we would work. The mutual coat. This one's warmer, but this one's cuter. Hair accessories. I love this one, but I also want to put your most on top. And I kind of love it. Neutral scarves, and matching gloves. And you are not getting cold. So do the lights in the watery Lionel eyes."," Friends, here are a few winter 2022 fashion trends I'm predicting. Of course, leather pants, knitwear, and chunky boots will continue to rain to premium this winter. I know Puffer jackets are a season staple, but this year I predict that long line puffers will be all the rage. Oversized blanket scarves, especially eclectic checkered ones, will be the accessory of choice as well as fun earmuffs. Next up, we're still loving the pleated skirts and sweater dresses. This time, we're focusing on fun stockings and tights as well as edged up loafers. Gangnam and Houndstooth will remain must-have prints and berets will add a pop of color. Follow for part 2!"," Here are some of the trends that we've already been seeing that I think will be very popular this spring and even this summer Let's get into it now. I am not an Emily in Paris stand, but this dress This dress I feel like I've been seeing bows everywhere especially on dresses It can be a little bit smaller like this or more big and dramatic with the sleeves like that super stunning Either way, I've also seen bows translated into hair accessories, which I think is very stunning and feminine I feel like it adds a little something to the outfit. It just makes it a little bit more elevated And I'm personally obsessed with this trend. I feel like Ariana kind of started to bring back bows on the voice And I really love her looks from the show in general She's also been wearing a lot of gloves, which I think will also be making a key statement this spring in summer Actually, maybe not this summer, but definitely in the spring and look at these cute little ones that I already have bows and then like Last but not least we've already been seeing these cardigans everywhere. I think they're here to stay and I think they're super"," Let's see if you'll get some trend predictions for spring 2022. First up, quilted jackets. I'm not a fan. Quilt belongs on your bed and nowhere else. She looks like she's wearing a comforter. Next up, big collars. I love it. I think huge collars are so fun. They're definitely a statement though. Next up, pin stripes. I love pin stripes, but I definitely would not style it like this. These are still dress pants, so I would wear them with a blouse or a blazer. Next up, fringe. This is giving me both Flopper Girl vibes in 2012 Coachella vibes, and I'm living for both. I'm very excited for this. And I'm even more excited to see how designers will be incorporating fringe into their clothes. Next up, statement gloves. I love statement gloves. They elevate every outfit, and I'm very excited to wear them for when I go out. So what do you think of these trends?",,,,,,,,
,," to update your spring looks for 2025. I've got you. Here are at six low effort spring trends that you can easily style with clothes that you already own. And the first one is red undershirts, which is a fresh and new way to play around with red accents. Next we have scarves, which is the it accessory of the season. And there are literally no limits to how you can style them. Then we are ditching black stockings and instead we're going for brown. I love how sophisticated and classy they look without feeling too heavy for the warmer season. This is a trend that I never thought we'd see again, but skirts and dresses over pants are back and people are finding ways to incorporate it into any style and any aesthetic. Speaking of pants we have cuffed himz. We can buy jeans already made like this or you can easily DIY them yourself. Then we have the belting everything trend like your cardigan, sweaters, jackets and blazers."," 24 winter fashion trends you absolutely need to know about. Interesting textures is gonna be all the rage of the winter. So think along the lines of first, sequins, big knits, anything that's heavily textured, adds a lot of depth and dimension to any outfit, and just makes it a lot more visually interesting. For example, I love this 3D knit turtleneck from Chetlo, and this cardigan from the Attico, it's just too good. I'm obsessed with this sweater, and it also comes in brown. Even playing with shapes and textures like this top from Isamiaki, or even holographic knit tops like this one from Jean Paul Goethei. Who also can do textured accessories, I love this super fuzzy beanie from Nohles. Denim Bag from Jacques Mousse would really add that extra oomph to an outfit. And I love the texture and color of these tabbies, just too good. But of course, you don't have to spend a ton of money. There are some affordable options, like this dress from Zara and this top are a really great texture. They also have these faux first straight like pants, and I think are super cool. I try these on in store, and they're so soft. And I just have to include this textured coat from MSGM. I love how it's styled here, like this is perfect.", women's trends for October 2024. I have seen this one everywhere which is swayed shorts. I think since MUMU have like put these out and shorts shorts have always been a trend this swayed is also coming in. I also think getting a pair of vintage ones is really cool as well especially with tassels on it. These from revolve are also a good option if you go like into cow hide but also that leads me onto the next trend which is cow hide jackets. I love this one this one is a bit softer as well and I think you'll have better luck finding one at an event to store. Whereas these ones look a bit cheap especially if they're not real but so you've got to be careful when you're getting a fake one and like what the finishes are like. Even an alternative like this is really cool. Then the final trend is healed loafers. Although these are Mary Jane's they sort of give the same shape. I wouldn't go for anything too chunky like this because this will date really quickly and you want to be able to wear them for years and years. I recently purchased these ones from a hairscar actually and they're really comfortable. But Zara also do some varieties too. These are super talons and it also great for a really good corporate to going out outfit.," Transfer spring and summer that you may or may not want to add to your wardrobe. I'm in hot with the all denim. I think instead of seeing more traditional like this, we're gonna see it more unique like this or something like this. Next to look I have been personally obsessed with is the lace with a big t-shirt. It can be a casual everyday look like this. Little more street style or something a little more formal and edgy like this. I'm obsessed. I recently recreated this look and it was one of my favorites. Red is not going anywhere but instead of big statement pieces, I think we're gonna see it in more accessories. Love that. Love this look. If you have not seen leopard anywhere then I think you might be living under rock but leopard is going to be huge. But not just pants, I think we're gonna be seeing it styled uniquely like this. Love this. Need this outfit. So good. Remember that trends come and go, your personal style is what actually matters. So incorporate things that you want to and just disregard what you don't."," Let's talk Must Have a Spring. First up, denim tops. I love a good denim and denim look, but I also think denim tops look really great with statement pants or skirts. Such a good way to mix it up from a typical top and their own way, they make their own statement. And plus they are so, so cute. And very timeless in my opinion, I particularly love a denim vest. Then we have striped button downs. Now stripes are trending this year, but if you're not totally in love with a pattern, I think a button down is a really great way to participate. You can find them in more of like a fine line. So the pattern is a little bit subtle, but mixes it up from just a typical, like straight color block kind of button down. And they come in so many different colors. And I think button downs look great on everybody, everybody needs one. And then we have bubble skirts. I love how this adds volume to your outfit. It is a really good mix up from a very typical hemline that we see especially with mini skirts. And we're bringing back the 70s a little bit. So we love a good throwback. And I just think they are so, so cheap."," I'm going to sell some winter 22 fashion trends. First up, shelling coats, hearing what these platter pants, sweater vest, my favorite boots. Here is the finished look. Next we're gonna do the oversized cable knit sweater. Let's start with a black miniskirt. I've got some tall boots in a bag. For another alternative, I'm gonna incorporate another trend, leather bomber jackets. I love it with this look. Last one, fair aisle, especially in sweaters. This one I kept a bit more casual, baggy jeans, a button up underneath, and some slippers. This is so cozy. All these trends I'm renting from the runway. It's a perfect way to keep up with the trends every season without having to buy things every season. They have so many designer brands. Very affordable and ethical, highly recommend renting."," I know it's still summer, but can we talk about fall fashion trends? This has been the summer of Barbie Pink, but for the fall season, red is taking over. And not just any shade of red, but it's this rich cherry red, and it's very easy to incorporate into your wardrobe. You can start with an accessory like a great handbag or a pair of red leather boots. Also, if you have any weddings you're attending in September or October, I think this would be a great color to wear as a wedding guest. Number two is ballet flats, which I'm so excited about. And depending on your personal style, there's so many variations to choose from. So if you want something that's a little bit more timeless and feminine, I would say go with like a Mary Jane style. And if your style is a little bit more on the edgy side, I would go with a pair of flats with studded details or big buckles. That whole quiet luxury trend will continue into the fall season and influence how we style our outfits. And what I'm loving are these textured knit cardigans. They almost kind of resemble like a blazer jacket, but they're done in a knit material. I think this is a great way to update your current network collection because it's a little bit more elevated than just an average sweater or cardigan. And the buttons on the front really give it a very expensive but quiet luxury feel. Lastly, tights are going to be huge. I'm talking colored tights, pattern tights. This is such an affordable way to update the current dresses that you already have in your closet. Maybe you just got bored of them, adding a pair of tights like this automatically takes your outfit to the next level, and just adds a little bit more interest and texture to your look."," the mo ratings for 2023 fashion trends as according to folk. First we have the no pants trend. Now this is it done very, very well. Like this is Emma Chamberlain at the G, he met at the year awards and my god, I'm obsessed with this. I think it works so well because the, no I wanna say it's because the material matches but then look at this next example. The material is also match here and it looks like shade highly babes. What were we thinking? This is a nappy if I've seen one. Yeah, I like the trend in theory because it can be done very well but there's also lots of room for it to go horribly, horribly wrong exhibit A. So I give this one a four. Dernan Maxi Scouts. Dernan Maxi Scouts my favourite. I just think they're really flattering silhouette for denim skirts so I would give this one a 10. What is it? Or does a guy love one to 10? How good would you rate yourself? 10. AirPods Maxes slash headphones but let's be real mainly AirPods Maxes. I had friends up around for ages but I suppose with the AirPods Maxes coming out they turned into like a fashion statement as well. Yeah, I like them. I think they serve the functionality of like an ear muff for example but obviously they give you some sound. I've just not really a headphone kind of girly because like I just feel a bit like a disc and populated. So love this for everybody else. I will not be partaking but I give this a eight. No, that's way too generous. A six because they're not really a fashion item. A super duper soft speedy view ton bag by Ferrell. For men. Fuckin' okay. Like the bag I think it's cool but I like who's holding it a bit more. So the bag itself, if we just take away, take it below the eye, no, I know. I like the yellow colour. Like it's a nice colour for the monogram print. But I feel like we've seen lots of yellow ones before so I don't really, is this like a revolutionary bag, probably not so I'll give it a seven. So radar, cotton box or shots. I love them. I think they're a really fun style of short. There's lots of different variations so there's still room for individuality within this trend. Like you can still take it and run with it. However, that might look a few. Yeah, I think they're a really cool trend to come out of 2023. But I feel like I came out of before that but whatever. I suppose they were like immensely popular last year. So yeah, we'll give these a nine. Zappies, that poor girl who's got her swaps. Like that is really rough. So my condolences. But I also understand why my guy was coming from, like they are lovely, lovely shoes. Yeah, tabbies are just great because they're a bit ugly. Like they're a bit ugly of a shoe design objectively. But that's what makes them so fucking cool. These are an 11. I love a good tepid. Frog Wellies by J.W. Understand. Did I miss these? The fuck are these? I didn't see, I didn't see or hear about these things. And I mean, I'm not particularly mad that I didn't. They're hideous. But for that reason, I kind of love them. Like let's be real. They're a bit of fun. But like, no, they're just like the chip fish fate that you get from like the fish slides. You can get in like Thailand at like a market. So I think that's kind of uninventive. Sorry J.W. Understand. But I don't think you really revolutionized the fish shoe here. I think you just made it froggy. Give this one a two. But I'd give it a 10 if like it was styled well. It could be, it could be done well. Messies non-bubby pink Miami jersey. I'm not sure why I have to differentiate why that it's not Barbie. Wait, wait, you know, I'm just breaking shade for un-bubby pink salt app and being roused for rich bootleg industry. There we go. The more you know. I do love a good football jersey. I've to be fair, this should be the one that I have because they're only football players I know, I'm messy and Ronaldo. So out of all of them, this is probably, this is like one of two options for me truly. But if you know of any, no, no, Magape, Magape, that's another one, isn't he? That, fuck yes, just for it. Not huge about the color, but yeah, I'll give it a six. Chanel cat eyes sunglasses. Are we really acting like these sunglasses are really into the world? Like, I don't really like them. I'm gonna give them a one. R-teen rose Nike shocks. I mean, these are just unreal. I love them so profoundly. It's like a, it's dressed up with the typical Nike shocks at the front of the shoe. It's like smart and casual. Smart casual, perfect for your next smart and casual event. 10. But I gave tabbies in 11. This is in 11 as well because they're on the same ball game for me. I fucking love these shoes. The cause quilted bag, despite them being like majorly overdone, I do like them as a style of bag. Like they're a massive oversized crossbody bag with lots of texture. So yeah, I'm into them. They're eight. French lip bracelets that never go out of style. Well, I feel like they're great for the, they're from the Taylor Swift concert. So like yeah, if you, they're a good memento, I guess. If you're Taylor Swift, it's like, your George. But beyond the concert, I think we need to just like keep it and they're like, lock them away somewhere. Like we do not need a big stack of Taylor Swift bracelets on the daily duties. Sorry, I'm gonna get murdered by the 50s. But yeah, I give these a two. Alias Tasefully Opulent Mary Jane's. Tasefully Opulent, I don't know. I mean, I like ballet flats as a trend, but out of all of them, this is the bottom of the barrel, let's be honest. You've got lots of, lots of diamondys bags, but you've got one star for me."," love trends. But sometimes when we see all these Instagram pictures on on Pinterest, it's hard to make these trends wearable for every day. So here is some outfit inspiration for the trendy girl that still wants to feel comfortable on an everyday basis. Starting off with this one, I am obsessed with this sundress if anyone knows where this in particular one is from. Please let me know. It's so fun and girly but also just so comfortable looking obviously. Really any variation of this outfit we all know button downs are everywhere this summer again. And you can really dress it up or down like this or like this with a kitten heel and a skirt. I am loving the return of like the longer cute louse with pants. And that sounds so simple but we haven't seen it in a minute where it wasn't like a highway sit in a crop top. And it just looks so comfortable and casual and I could wear it to so many different kinds of occasions. Next, dressing up an casual outfit like a tank top and pants like this with one of these skinny scarfs. I love this how it's like a skinny scarf necklace. You can not go wrong with a maxi skirt and which is like with a plain tank top like this. It's so understated but then if you dress up with accessories it can look so elevated and chic. Oh, good morning.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," Hey everybody, welcome to Susie's Hanoi office. Super excited to have Heidi here. We're gonna be going through Spring 2022's Hot Trends, what's happening, and how do we order that in? So let's get started. So one of the hottest trends this spring is all about monochromatic dressing. What that means is really kicking a color palette and bracing it from head to toe. So it could be a different shade of the same color. Or it can be really matchy-matchy. For example, we have these gorgeous pants that are super fluttering and great for work, even for going out at night. I'm carrying it with something like this, which is a gorgeous satin blouse, and the same blush color. It really makes a beautiful long-lane silhouette and the super fluttering. I'm carrying on that whole theme of monochromatic dressing goes in with the mixing and matchy. So we have these gorgeous knit sets. It comes in a beautiful color like this heel. Super fluttering, and the key about these and the fun thing is that you can mix and match the pieces to make a lot of different wardrobe possibilities. So one option is to do the head to toe teal. And then if you want to mix it up, we have another option, which is something like the coordinating stripe. So you can kind of have two different looks. One that makes a bit of a more of a dress, one piece, and then mixing it up to do more of a two piece set. Going along with that whole monochromatic dressing look, you can take it to the next level where you're working in some prints. So again, we have our beautiful knit tank carried with a beautiful floral mini skirt. And again, you're getting that whole head to toe look, but adding a little more personality and a little feminine and a big wintr skirt. So that's another option. One thing that's super hot, also the spring. I'm sure you've been seeing it on the redways. They had me awards. It's all about the cutout skin. It is in for spring. So for Susie, we really took the trend. It may not be wearable for the everyday woman, because we know we're not going out on red carpets, and we're not walking around and you know, broad tops and exposed things. So we kind of took the trend and we incorporated in a way that super tings fall in easy to wear. So we have a beautiful dress like this. It just has this nice little detail. This is something that you can wear like for work easily. And then maybe with a blazer over, with a off your blazer, a change up your jewelry, and you have like a really nice sexy dress. For going out for dinner or for drinks. It's got a little peekaboo. A little peekaboo. A little hint of skin. Love it. So continuing along with that trend again, we have this peekaboo top, which is something like super sexy, form fitting. It's pretty enclosed, has nice long sleeves, or somebody that doesn't want to show like too much skin. It just has a little bit of that detail, just to kind of give a hands a little flurry, something something. This would look lovely. It's what it is. The next big trend we have is, for spring, is really all about texture. So these great blazers, that Chanel inspired, that can kind of go with anything. You can put it within jean, and have a really sophisticated, kind of like lunch every day, look with an easy top. You can put it with something like you're wearing now, even the black dress cat, and just switch it out for something like this. A little super professional. So a great blazer like this is something that's great for the weather, when it's transitioning, also from a bit colder to warmer. You can throw it on and take it off as needed, but texture, texture, texture, texture for spring. Love it, love it. It's like you got the silky, and then the tweed feel, and look at these sleeves. I love the cubs sleeve. Beautiful. This, with what I'm wearing, again, is so mix-and-match. So we hope you loved our intro to Suzy's Spring 2020 trend. She's going to take it away. I will be wearing all of my favorite things, you're going to have to just stay with me and watch me, eat my way through the city, dress head to toe, and my girl says, thank you so much.",,,,,,,,
,," and fashion trends that are going to be huge in 2025, part one. Number one, Swade. It was a huge trend last year and it's back and bigger than ever. We're going to see Swade Jacket, Swade Cotes, Swade Blazers, Swade Scirts like this are going to be huge, not forgetting trainers and of course loafers. Number two is refined athletes you wear. Elevated comfy stables, a particular influence from softer sports like Palates and yoga. Number three, a huge trending color is going to be soft powdery pink, stepping away from the bright barbie core pink and leaning into a soft glender pink. This is a great one as we get into the spring summer. But you could start incorporating it now if you want to get ahead. Number four, bubble hens, particularly bubble hens skirts and dresses. I've already seen them creeping in over winter 24, but spring summer 25, I felt like we're really going to see this trend take over. Number five, maximalism. Quiet luxury dominated last year. We're now seeing its counterpart taking over the runways. This trend it's all about more is more."," you have reached that point in the winter where you feel like you hate everything in your wardrobe. It might be because you're missing or forgetting you have these key pieces. First piece is a cardigan to layer. We're wearing coats and jackets all the time. It's so easy to be bored of your jackets but adding layering pieces like this, even in brighter statement colours that you love. It's getting dressed and styling so easy. To make them look chic and crisp, we need a white t-shirt as a base. Because having this sort of framing on a jumper looks so good. There's something about it that looks luxury, it looks expensive. You're looking for a new knitwear piece of v-neck jumper, I'm really advised. But also an oversized cable-neck jumper. You're forgetting you have a pair of jeans you love. We've been speaking so much about the oversized denim and that can be hard to start in the winter. You need to buy yourself more of a slim fit, Jean, because this looks so fit together but so easy to throw on. I hope that helps. Bye!"," 2024 fall fashion trends, let's break it down. This cinched, waste hourglass shape is taking over fall fashion. We're gonna see it especially in coats and blazers like this, like this, and even sweaters. I also think that belts are gonna be the hot fall accessory because you can achieve that cinched waist look without the actual tailoring. And we'll also see them just as like statement pieces. This one might shock you, but cow hide. Don't worry, the leopard and cheetah print aren't going anywhere, but I think we're gonna see a rise of cow hide or even in like a statement piece like this skirt. There's definitely a theme going on this fall and it's western wear. There is gonna be a lot more studs. In the summer, we already saw a lot of studs on shoes like ballet flats, but now they're gonna be coming over into bags. We're gonna see them all over the bag and then also more subtly and detailed like this. And I think studs on a sway jacket would be adorable. Get your square toe boots, add your closet, they're coming back. The pointed toe boots took over last fall, but we're moving back to a more rounded or square toe boot, like these. We're also gonna see the moto boots come back again, but with less hardware. The color of the season is green. I quite literally mean any shade of green too. Brat green, AK, sharp truce, sage green, and every shade of green in between. Let me know if you want a part two."," because it's on trend does not mean you need to give into it. These are the four trends that I'm not giving into just as somebody who loves fashion. This is gonna be controversial, but the bow hair ties, just anything bows on them. I don't like just because I'm gonna be 30 years old, so and I'm not trying to look cute, I'm trying to look hot. So bows is just gonna be a huge no for me. So let's talk about ballet flats. I cannot stop thinking about smelly feet. No matter, no matter the no-show socks, no-show socks never stay up on me, but I just cannot, especially in the summer, people wearing them with mini dresses, I cannot stop thinking about how disgusting and how much sweat your feet are sweating. I just can't do it. And I think with dresses, I'd rather wear a sandal, not a ballet fly. Any barrel jeans makes you look bo-legged. And that is something that I'm just not interested in. You either pick baggy, skinny or straight leg. I don't understand the bo-legged trend. It also super in right now that I don't understand. Puffy your shirts, I get it. Like feminine girly era is here to stay, but the Puffy shirts, I just prefer a tighter shirt that's gonna accentuate my figure. I tend to drown in shirts and clothing, especially being five, two. I will not be participating in a Puffy shirt. So just because you see the trend videos is not meaning me participating. It's super informative. I like do it with it, with it what you will, but do not take it seriously. I'm not the type of person who's gonna be participating in every single trend, and neither should you, honestly. So what trends do you not agree with or what trends do you not like and you're not gonna be participating in? Because who knows, we might make this a series, let me know."," 2024 spring fashion trend in Zenox. Let's get into it. Lepard print, pointed toe pumps, and dark cherry red are all still gonna be trending this coming spring. Even though the Dita Saumbas phased out a little bit over winter, we're gonna see the make a comeback this spring and summer. Cobalt Blue is gonna continue trending through spring but will phase out over summer. Sheer lace is absolutely still in, but swap out your denim maxi skirts for Silk or Satin. I'm not super on board with this trend yet, but Capri pants are in. Theathers and metallic bow detailing are out. Lastly, chunky statement earrings are still in, and you're gonna be seeing Silk and Satin everywhere this spring. I hope this video really helped you. Let me know in the comments if you want a part two and hit that follow for more fashion tips. Bye."," Winter fashion trends worth the buy and what you can leave behind. Now we are in the season of big coat energy and I recommend an oversized wool coat, one that can be easily dressed up or dressed down. Best believe we can leave behind this headed for a puffer coat. And you know, we can say this for taking the dogs, the dog park or shoveling snow. We can leave these construction boots behind, your feet deserve better. Now I recommend you reaching for a chunkier boot, one that is gonna give your wardrobe more versatility. We're leaving behind this oversized asymmetrical knitwear. I mean, this type of top only pairs well with leggings and those skinny jeans. Instead, you're gonna add a black turtleneck into your wardrobe. This is gonna be perfect for the winter season because not only can you wear it on its own, but it can also be used as a great layering piece. What would you be buying or leaving behind this winter season? Let us know in the comments. I hope this helps. Bye bye."," Let's talk about 2020 fashion trends. We've seen the runaways, we've seen more runaways. We've seen the fashion start to roll out, and now let's talk about more trends that we're seeing today, how to style them, how to wear them, talk about it all. This is so interesting, but the exposed broad trend is back. Pick that mom's everywhere, we're yelling at us for a stop showing. If the exposed broad trend has really been more introduced by celebrities, but we did see it on the runaway. So now it's kind of like been deemed officially a part of fashion trends. Now so it's very interesting. We're seeing a lot of articles, it really was kind of brought back more by I think celebrity stylists, but it's very interesting to see. Sometimes it can be quite a bit, but there are some very, very elegant ways that I've seen, which is very well done, very tastefully. Amazon finds it's a good way to incorporate it. If you're not really sure that this is your style, you're trying to, but this is something huge, anti-variant, I don't know, it's a lot more elegant than I think what we think in our heads it might look like. So I got very small ways of incorporating this little pop, I would say, just like a little pop, little sprinkle. Let's talk about shoulders and business wear. So we've talked about it before, and we're really, really seeing strong, bold shoulders and business wear, really, really coming to fashion. Obviously that's already in fashion, but this fall they're really taking it to a whole new level. We're seeing patented shoulders, we're seeing things with a lot more stronger silhouettes and just a lot of different kinds. In addition to that, we're seeing in the very business style form a fashion kind of roll over into sets. Here we have so many leather sets, everyone saying, leather sets are in, I think that they've been in for quite some time, but we're really starting to see them be a lot more practical and wearable. So we pulled together in a much more elegant, like fashion girly sense way. So I think this is so cool. So fun, there's a lot we can do with that. We've got jacket leather pants. I'm really just sat on the leather on top of each other. That could be very, very fun. Especially with the bike or boot trend, this could all be really cute and really cool if done well and kind of properly proportioned. I've talked about another riddy up, but the rise of the ballet flats are very, very much back. We're seeing them take on a much more instructed, kind of more elegant silhouette. These are our great examples. They're very pricey, but a great example. The square toe, very, very cute. Actually, and I hate ballet flats, but I think these are very cute. They're being brought into fashion a lot more stylish way. It's a lot more versatile rather than classical and that we were thrown in in middle school with the little bows on it or like the ones that we rolled when we put in that purse. Very interesting, very cute. Again, I'm not the biggest fan of this, but it's really starting to grow on me because we're seeing so many different kinds and these are stunning. There's so many articles online, but El releases headline calling it classic tailoring. That's a great way that I would put it. Just things that are very well constructed, very well form fitting to your body. Instead of that, they're not baggy, but they're just very, to have clean tailoring. Classics we've been going to and just fun ways of incorporating it so you could do like a big red bag. You'd have some nice trousers on in the giant green bomber jacket. So there are a lot of fun ways where you can have very well constructed pieces in your wardrobe and add just fun pops of color, fun items you might not normally pair with them. So I love that, super fun."," 2023 summer fashion trends. The first trend is the old money in quiet luxury aesthetic. This trend is all about looking elevated and classic with basic staple pieces. We are moving towards looks that are really simple but look really classic and elegant. So this summer definitely invest in good quality basic pieces. Next one is vintage bags and vintage shoes. Thrifting items is not new whatsoever but this year this vintage shoes and vintage bags are super trendy. Everyone is going crazy for these bags and for these shoes. I love when we have sustainable fashion trends. You cannot tell me you haven't seen this, the or pointy toe heels a million times already but at the same time these items are limited and are unique pieces which is definitely what makes them so special. Next one are white jeans. This definitely comes from the quiet luxury trend. I've been saying white jeans so much. It's a great piece to look casual but at the same time quite elevated. They are definitely way more dressy than a regular pair of jeans and for summer they are absolutely perfect. Next trend is flowers. Flowers on tops, flowers on dresses, in shoes and literally everywhere. I mean I'm wearing a flower too. So it's quite obvious that I love this trend. It's such a great way to add a little bit of a next-to-a-detail to any outfit and they even elevate any outfit in my opinion."," Hey, it's me. And I'm here to talk to you about some fashion trends that I want to see for 2023. So let's get to it. We have a background now. And I also made a list. Number one, overalls. Overalls is so classic and fun and easy to dress up. There's different denims, fabrics, textures, lengths. You can add pins on them, cuff them up. It's just variations. I love them. Next up is big glasses. Nature is better. And in 2023, we are doing bigger and better things. So we need to see bigger and better things. After 2020's trend with loose sunglasses, we need to move on to big sunglasses now. Next up, ponchos and capes. Now when I say ponchos and capes, I don't mean look like you're on it yet. Thanksgiving dinner. I mean fashion 70, big bow patterns. It's comfortable and stylish. We're more can you get? That's it for now. Let me know in the comments if I should make a part two. Because I'm gladly wrong."," You live somewhere hot but still want to keep up with fallen winter trends and feel fallen winter. Here's what I would do. And I've lived in Texas my whole life, so these are tried and true. A big trend that I've seen emerging lately are these off the shoulder tops. I think they're great for warmer weather. You can make it more wintery by doing a sweater version, speaking of sweaters. I think a good crop sweater is a must if you live somewhere hotter. Like this. And the crop sweaters like this are so trendy right now. And I think the same could be said for cropped coats. This whole aesthetic is super trendy right now and I think it's great for warm weather. There are two wearing skirt and a few too hot just take the blazer off. Next up is my favorite mini skirt and knee high boot combo. I don't know what the science is behind this but it just winter. Also mini skirts paired with leg warmers. Adding panty those or tights to just about any outfit. I did not even mean to use this one twice. Next up is Nipoleros, especially without trendy they are right now. Let me know if you want to part too."," Breaking down some fall fashion trends that we're gonna be seeing this year. And PSA, this is not just personal opinion. I got all of this from Marie Claire. Leather is going to be huge, like all leather outfits like this. And this. This outfit is seriously stunning. Hot pink is gonna be all the rage. I love the way that she styled this jacket. Like, say what you want, but she looks really sheep. Sequence is going to be a thing. She looks absolutely amazing. Lots of cool jackets, like bomber jackets and aviator jackets. Lots of basics, so like basic blazers, basic turtleneck. I'm totally recreating this outfit. And lots of caramel tones. The red with the caramel, gorgeous. I feel like everyone needs a jacket like this. This is a staple."," Spring and Summer 2022 fashion trends. Whether you love it or hate it, low-rise jeans are on their way back in. And so are mid-rise, which I think are a lot more wearable. I can't lie, I hated it at first, but it's kinda growing on me. We've been so used to crop tops, but with the return of lower-rise jeans, we're also gonna be seeing a lot more longer shirts. Another surprising return at the ballet flats. And they don't have to be like the typical ballet flat like the ones I just showed. These follow a lot of current trends. Tube tops are definitely gonna have their moment this spring and summer. We're gonna be seeing a lot of please-safe fabric. And we're already seeing it a lot in sets, I love it. We're gonna be seeing a lot of the sweetheart neckline, even a bit more subtly like this, or this. We're also starting to see a lot more flared or bell sleeves. Like for part two."," 2021 trends that we'll see less of this year. I'm not telling you to get rid of any of these things. In fact, please don't. Small bags, including baguettes will still be in. I think we're gonna see a lot of people opt for bigger ones, especially toads. I don't really think this will be as much of a thing this year. I think it's just one of those trends that looks really cool in photos, but it's not very practical. Don't freak out, but I think we're gonna see less in the Far Line jackets. I also think we're gonna see fewer corsets, especially underboot corsets. I also think we're gonna see less dip-dye jeans and just tie dye in general, especially on pants. And fewer of these drawstring dresses, you know what I'm talking about. Like for the next part.",,,,,,,,
,," Guys, let's talk about Spring Summer Trends 2025. I've seen a lot of interesting things, but I want to mention just some of the the most wearable, the most cheek and you know you can basically implement those right away in your look. Coastal cheek something like this has stripes and you know it's an easy vacation-tired look. If you're like living somewhere next to the coast it's gonna be a big go to this summer. So many iterations of these blouses and even pants with bows I think they're very feminine, very beautiful and you can style them in so many ways. And the style is back and it's back more feminine way. We can do a lot of really cool styles like this with ruffles, with different dresses, with different skirts and even blouses like that. It's gonna be preppy looks are gonna be really big. It looks like you're out from a uni or you know you're in that 80s allied club. It's gonna be pretty big sport. Combined with a little bit of casual and shake and great combination perfect for everyday wear and very comfortable to. Not of olive green. It's gonna be a lot a lot of olive green. There's so many ways to style it. I've all to see more ways and also there's gonna be blush pink, and a battery yellow and more blouses like this. Like I told you guys there are so many variations. They are super cute. They're super feminine. If he was waiting for something to be more feminine to wear some cute outfits this is your sign."," have a degree in fashion, let's talk about the winter fashion trends. Balaclavas are going to be the accessory that all of the cool girls are going to wear this winter. Not only these are extremely comfortable and cozy, they are also so chic and so cool. I personally prefer the ones that have the little strings and I love how they look with sun glasses. If you're looking for a balaclava, I recommend to try to find one that is a little bigger than your head. As you can see, this is definitely smaller and it doesn't look that good. It looks so much better when it's a little bit of a larger fit and you can just stick a little bit of your hair out of the balaclava. The 20th color for this winter is probably going to be burgundy. Burgundy and black looks amazing together and honestly I think that it's going to be the new black this season. Jackets like this, we are going to see a lot and my personal favorite are going to be the monochromatic burgundy looks. This is perfect for the holiday season. The fair aisle sweaters, even though this is kind of a holiday type of sweater, we have not been seeing it a lot this past seasons but this winter, this type of sweaters are going to be super trendy. There are so many different designs and I'm sure that it's going to become a seasonal piece of clothing that it's always going to come back for the winter and holiday season. The 90s ski wear. This is an aesthetic that we started seeing last winter and sometimes I even have a hard time figuring out if this is from the 90s or if this is current. Like this picture looks so 90s or this one as well. I am obsessed with this aesthetic. We are also going to see a lot of red and monochromatic locks with ski wear and this ski suit that are almost kind tied and they are so sexy but at the same time so chic."," What cool girls will be wearing for fall 2024? Part two, bold colors. A style definitely stands towards the cottage core that we've been seeing. Makes it off at very girly, but also adds some texture. Bolder the color, the better. I actually really love this top. If you are obsessed with that style, I'd go for a boat neck top. This just adds a little bit of variation from a traditional neckline, but isn't as bold as a huge collar. Ski core, specifically with sweaters. Think chunky sweaters with bold designs. You can go for sweaters with more of that traditional pattern. This style also goes for more of a colorful sweater. Actually obsessed with this. Moto jackets. Leather jackets have risen in popularity and become very much a staple, but this year we're gonna be seeing more of that Moto edgy style. Think oversized with a built-in belt. Last fall, I feel like the leather jackets were more of a blazer style, so this is a really good sweatup. This style gives the outfit a bit of an edge, and I love the dimension that is added with the belt and extra zippers. For jackets and bigger, the better. The oversized style adds a lot of volume to your outfit, and I love the texture that it brings to a fit. And if you can swing it, I'd go for a trench style. I just think it makes the outfit so cool."," talking about fashion trends that are going to start emerging in late summer and become really big in autumn winter 2425. I'm a full-time trend researcher working in fashion trend forecasting and this is what I think is going to be trending this summer. Suit trousers are going to be a really important key item in your wardrobe. We're going to be looking for some new interesting waistband details. We've seen this item so much on the runway. We're going to be styling it for daily looks and occasion wear. This cool grey tone is going to dominate this category because we're going to be styling a really neutral 90s minimalist looks using silver and gold detailing so this color is perfect. It's a great layering piece and essential basic but the waistband is so important and that's why we're going to see all the newness. Like with this wrap silhouette. Let me know if you have a pair of suit trousers like this, how have you been styling them and how are you going to style them going into autumn winter 2425?"," Let's talk about trends that you're going to want to know about for Spring 2024. The first trend that I think that we're going to see a continuation of are these sling backs or mules. I'm loving the lace here and how unique it is. These are also a great heel for elevating any look but not taking away from it. And for the spring, I'm excited about whites and lighter colors and pistols being used in shoes. Another trend that I think that we're going to see is denim and accessories, specifically handbags and shoes. For example, these, these, and my favorite these with the added flower details. I am most looking forward to this trend of the maximalist jewelry. I'm loving the idea of stacking a bunch of bangles and mixing metals. I think that with this trend we're going to see a lot of statement necklaces mixed withs and finishes of bangles and that a lot of pendant necklaces specifically coins. And last but at least, make-or-shorts. I'm loving the comfortable nature of this outfit, especially paired with the boots. We've seen the beginning of the make-or-short trend with leather, but I think that it'll move into denim and change the way that we wear denim shorts."," Bonjour and welcome to French Style Fridays. Today we're going to look at the classic winter trends that French women are wearing right now. First up is chunky loafers. Chunky loafers have been a major player in the fashion scene this season with Prada, Gucci, everyone giving them a world and French girls love to wear them too. Next up is fluffy coats. French women really love the 70s aesthetic and this is kind of really impetimized by the kind of fur board coats we're seeing right now. French women are really good for dressing for cold weather and this kind of belted jacket trend is something on Keep Seeing on the streets of Paris. Sticking on the jacket theme, French women love to wear oversized glazers just because you can get things like really chunky knitwear or cardigans layered underneath them super easily. And last but not least we have knee high boots. Although they are quite classic and very current right now, French women have been wearing them for so long it's hard to even wear."," It's step time again. Let's dive into the hottest fall trends for 2023. Trend number one is cozy layers. Oversized sweaters. Shake cardigans. Stay warm and stylish. Also, we're gonna see a lot of red. Think about pairing those oversized sweaters and chick cardigans. We're a red twist. I love this one. Trend number two. Erzy tones. Think warm browns, green, rusty oranges, like this or like this. One trend you definitely don't want to miss out on is of the shoulder sweater tops. Whether you pair them with high waist jeans or a kid's skirt, these sweaters are a must have for your full wardrobe."," Ladies, I get it. And don't you worry, I'm here to help. You're a millennial. Maybe you're a mom. And you wanna dress cute and trendy, but you do not wanna dress like you're 14. And you do not wanna dress like it's 2014. Hey, I'm Lauren on the stylist, and I'm here to help you feel confident going into the next season. Comment down below if you want me to keep this series going. And don't forget to save and share with friends. And like always following for more. You cannot tell me we all don't remember this love. The button, jeans skirt, the gladiars, and the off the shoulder top. I feel like we all did this. But let's talk about how to make it better. And don't worry, everything's appealing to my buy-up. Okay, perfect. I feel like the button jeans skirt is a little dated, still cute. But this is a bench flattering option, in my opinion. I love this top, still curly, fun. And it is a little cropped. But unless you have like a long torso, it should be able to still like, tuck into your high waisted skirt. Because not everyone's a cropped fan, totally understand. I added this fun little cream bag. And instead of the gladiator sandals, I did this little heel. I do love a lace up ankle moment. But the way it bunches at the ankle is just a little bit more modern. And I traded out the studs for these beautiful gold. To drop areas. And if you're feeling really like you want to push the limit, I do recommend these longed-to-ums skirt. They're so trending right now and they're very cute. But I also like the shorter one to me, as a little more timeless piece. But I do love these. Okay, that was so much fun. Let me know how you like this look."," Hi, my name is Ani, I'm a personal stylist and I'm going to go over some trends we're seeing at New York Fashion Week on the runway and I'm going to give my thoughts about them. Sometimes a lot of normies like myself wonder what the heck are they doing on the runway? This cannot transfer into my life or my fashion and something to keep in mind is that runway trends are an exaggerated version of what we're going to see in street style and they're going to make their way into our favorite brands like Azara, Madewell, Upper Cromby, etc. So let's get into it. Alright, denim one denim we're seeing it everywhere. It's a huge trend right now. I like it if it's broken up if you see a little bit of skin or a belt. I like how she it kind of looks like she buttoned the top button and showed a black shirt underneath. I'm into it. I think it can be executed poorly or well and I think I'm going to try it out. Wearing lingerie as part of her outfit, we've seen this for a while now at least a couple years and I like it. Okay, just talk smack about crochet tops but the way we're seeing it on the runway is definitely different from how we saw it in the past 10 years. So keep that in mind and I'm always into a crochet look like I said. So if there's an updated version, I'm all about that. Lots of lime green and I'm super into this as far as like color goes like I don't have a ton of color in my closet but I'm all about green. A lot of inspiration from like ballerinas, they're calling it ballet core. I think it's super cool and feminine and I think that it's an easy way to incorporate some like trends that you're seeing in the runway into your everyday life like with just like skirts with similar some silhouettes and tool. I think it's cool. Oversize leather leather everything into it. I have a ton of leather and I think it's cool. Crisp tailored suits. This has been in for a little while and it's still going strong super into it. Sheer, sheer everything, sheer dresses, sheer tops. I love it when it's intentional. If it's not intentional, don't do it. But I think this is super cute and I might wear something like this for a Valentine's Day date night this week. So, oversized blazers, we've been seeing these for a while, still in, still cool and I still love it. All right, let's talk about a trend. I hate. I despise this trend so much. The optical illusion trend. I get a visceral reaction. I don't want this to be a thing. Make it stop. Please make it stop. Lastly, another trend I can't get behind is the long denim skirt. I just, I just can't. I just, I just think you can achieve the same look with jeans and it looks way better. Anyways, that's it. Like and follow from our style and spell."," It feels like negative 25 degrees Fahrenheit, so let's put together a chic and warm outfit. First up are these super heavy-duty leather pants. Over the leggings, thermal top, total neck over that, and a wool sweater over that. Boots with long socks, these actually come up to my knees because I just wanted the extra warmth. Long fur coat, leather gloves, and a hat. I'm ready to go."," Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that loafers are everywhere right now. We're going to be seeing a lot of loafers in different styles for fall and I anticipate for some part of the winter too. I've shared before I got my loafers at H&M. A lot of people like to go for like a buckle or something that really adds a well factor to the loafers. I personally want it just like a classic one and I didn't want the sole too too big. I really appreciate the platform ones but sometimes those can kind of hurt my back and you know she and her 30 so she got to take care of her back. But aside from that if you're not into this kind of loafers you can always opt out and go for a more I guess simple loafers and I will show you some examples but I also want to show you address your loafers. So I actually picked one up yesterday at H&M as well. So for me if I'm going to wear a heel and needs to be comfortable. So what I typically do with heels is I wear them around my apartment to make sure that I can walk in them for a few hours and I've been doing that. They're super comfortable. They're a loafer but with a heel, a chunky heel and a buckle. Since I want to keep these loafers the ones I showed you guys first for work. Something a little bit more simple and comfortable. I'm going to keep those for work and just for like running errands or outfit days whatever. This is more going out, cute outfits, wearing it with a skirt, wearing it with a dress. Let me show you. Ta-da! Aren't these so pretty? Okay I got these for $49.99 and they were a size 37.6 I guess. But let me give you a closer look. They're so pretty and they're really comfortable and the platform is very easy to walk in. So if you're looking for something a little bit more fancy, shmancy go for these but let me give you some other ideas. So you can always go for some slides. These still have a cute little buckle and they're not as bulky and they look pretty comfortable. So these I like because they're classic but they also have a little bit of that edgy element that has a square toe to the front and just makes them look so unique. These are from ASOS. You can also opt out for the black ones and get a nice bone color. These are so pretty. They're so elegant. These are perfect for work. You can wear them with dresses with skirts, you name it. These are from J. Crew and they're just classic. These are also from Zara and they have a very dainty buckle to them. They look comfortable and they're also very simple and not too big and heavy and they just look nice."," Spring and Summer 2022 fashion trends. Part six, or it might possibly be seven, I don't know. We're gonna be seeing more Gothic or Gothic inspired looks. I've already been seeing this a lot on the runway, and in a lot of our current trends, like mesh leather chains like this. Next up, very similar to dopamine dressing, we have color clashing. I'm especially seeing it with pinks and oranges and purple in general. It can be done a bit more subtly like this or this. We saw a lot of the checkered board pattern last year. We're gonna be seeing it a lot more this spring and summer too. That's cute. I especially think we're gonna be seeing it with more color. Like, I actually need this in my closet right now. We're gonna be seeing a lot of shorts and boots, even though we're loving Western right now, it doesn't have to be a bit more like this or this. You cannot forget about the mid cap boots, especially for those of us who live in the South. Like for Part seven, possibly eight."," of the trends from the long fashion week runway that we think you should know. There was a lot of poolside glamour, everything from bodies and boots. So what I assume Meredith Blake wears to a pool party. There were a lot of gothic references this season. Crosses were a really big theme here. I was these gorgeous gothic inspired collars. Glorals, first spring, ground breaking. Brent's just been popping up for the last few seasons, but I love this very fun summary twist. Of course, diesel did it in a denim. Crazy clashing prints were everywhere. This is something you can easily make casual and easily dress up. And if you're looking for your spring summer accessory, opera gloves are here to stay. Personally, I'm very grateful for them.",,,,,,,,
,," Okay, Paris at the end of March sounds so fun, but cool girls will be wearing for a spring trip in 2025. The research that I did, Paris and March is still pretty cold. So here's a few things that I would suggest. Wool blazers. I feel like this is a really good option for not giving as much winter vibes, while still being very, very warm. Something like this is a really great example. And if you need more warmth, you can always layer underneath this, which I really like. I really like the gray blazers, but you could also go with a light sweater and then a brown blazer instead of the gray. For more of a casual look, I do love a good denim on denim set. And with keeping the weather in Paris in mind, I would go for something long-sleeved. And if you want to add more color to the fit, you can always do that through sneakers. If the denim on denim set isn't warm enough, you can always add a coat or a blazer or a jacket on top. Also, love adding suede to a denim on denim set. I'd say a little bit of contrast to the outfit. And with denim on denim sets, at least matching sets, I do feel like you can really play around with the shoes because they kind of become more of a focal point, kind of like this. Colorful sweaters or even accessories are going to be your best friend. I think it's cute even to layer a sweater on a sweater. She has a varying neutral outfit, but then the pop of color comes from this yellow sweater that she has slung over her shoulders. And sweaters are so easy to dress casually, kind of like this. You can even take it a step further and do like a more monochromatic look with a jacket. Lastly, I would definitely bring a trench jacket. So if it's like a canvas type, I mean, you could totally go for like a wool as well, just depending on the weather. I do love the canvas style for springtime. So lovely, I wear sweater over the shoulders. If you don't like the longer style, you could always go for a cropped. As styles really well over sweaters, which you're gonna be bringing anyways, or you could put the trench jacket over your denim and denim set. So, so cute."," What's hot? Winter 2024 Part 3. Today we're gonna be talking about statement accessories that will take your look up a notch this winter. Fur bucket hats. Girls fur bucket hats are so elegant and classy this winter. It looks really good, dressed up or down. It looks good with sunglasses. It looks good with different color here. It looks good in every color. So get you one. A regular headband. These plain headbands are so cute right now. They have them in every color. You can do white. You can do burgundy. You can dress it up like this. Very dressy or down like this going to the gym or doing yoga. Statement sunglasses. You can do a white sunglasses or a black one. You can do one that matches your coat. It looks really good. This winter get you a statement pair of sunglasses. An oversized one will do just good or you can get one that is more vintage. Right now girls get you another pair of leather gloves especially with the fur like this. Leather gloves scream elegant and rich and I actually love the ones that go up the arm like that. Look at Jasmine Tux. This look has everything it's stunning. I absolutely love it. Would you wear this? Like and follow for more."," What cool girls will be wearing for fall 2024? Green. Last fall, red was the it color, but green is taking its place this year. We'll be seeing it use as a statement and outfits, kind of like this. I absolutely love the pants and combination with the lighter green button down. If you don't like bright green, you could always go for more of like a utility green. Especially, love this color in a monochromatic moment. Green also pairs so nicely with so many different colors. This alpha is a really great example. Lepor print. Lepor print has been trending all year and falls no different. Really love it paired with bright colors, like this pink sweatshirt. It also adds a little bit of fun to a very neutral outfit. If you're not into the pants, you could always go for a maxi skirt, paired with some sneakers, your favorite jacket, and accessories. I love this jacket, it makes such a great statement to a very simple outfit. Fitted Blazers. We've been really into like the oversized blazer look, but I feel like this is a really great change. It creates such a nice silhouette. The style is really great if you're not into an oversized look, especially love this look, and a set. Mini skirts. So glad that they have risen and popularity over the past few years. We've seen lots of pleated skirts, as well as denim. This style looks amazing with loafers. Pairs so nicely with a jacket and love the girly edge that it adds to an outfit."," full-time trend research are working in fashion trend forecasting and these are my quick fire predictions for full 2024 fashion.

Let's talk spring 2024 fashion trends and have a style them. Let's get into it. Firstly and most importantly, leopard print. The Iq girls this year? Yes, they are in fact wearing leopard print. We saw it start in fall and now it's been integrated into spring and summer. And let me tell you, this trend has a chokehold on me. It can be so diverse whether it's a leopard dress or leopard pants. Like, for you guys, I'm not going to be able to whisper for very long. Iq girls will specifically be wearing leopard pants. I mean a stunning outfit. In addition to leopard dresses, leopard skirts, let's see how we can style them. Dress this upper down. You can wear it with a regular t-shirt and a biker jacket like we just saw in the last picture. Or you can take this red trend that has developed into fall and integrated into spring and summer looks because Iq girls, we keep fashion trends going. We don't just wear them once in toss, we keep our things and we reuse them. We create more, better, exciting outfits every single time, every time the season changes. This pop of red is so cute. It's going to stay, it's going to stick and I absolutely love it. Another way of jeans and pants are not your thing. With this skirt with a blazer, you can dress it up, be a little more classy, you can wear it in an office. There are so many ways to integrate this. It is unbelievable and I love it. We're seeing uncommon combinations that we normally wouldn't see. Things that we would think would clash. Like that little bit of red that we saw in the leopard pair of pants. It's pants with this button down shirt that is striped. Workwear and pin stripes are huge this year, but integrating the two clashes. Yet Iq girls are wearing it. We're breaking all the rules this spring and summer and we were doing what we want and what we want. That is how to be in a girl in fashion. Who cares what anyone has to say because we're going to style the way we want you, but these are just of my ideas. The fact that ballet flats have continued is so funny to me. They are growing on me. They are taking over. I was not expecting it. Let me tell you, but pairing them. A leopard pants is iconic, amazing, incredible. Not for me, but you guys look great. Basic T is an easy way to wear this with some sneaker and of course, throw a little matrix style in there. Why not do the turtle neck? Why not do black blazer with a sunglasses and little booties? I think this is iconic. Now what I really want to point out here is the cross between trends. We have three trends happening here. We have the leopard print pants, ballet flats, and we have a silver shoe trend going on, the metallics. So just like this picture, this one. And now this one, we're seeing trends cross contaminate as I would like to call it. Just getting this unsu awful, but we're seeing them combine together. And I think that it is so fun. Little pops of red are so cute, so stunning. They with leopard print pants aren't your thing. A leopard print maxi skirt may be off the shoulder trend, phenomenal, gorgeous. She is an Iq girl. She's stunning. She's gorgeous. She's wearing what she wants, but she's also in fashion. She can't be stopped. She just doesn't do one trend. She does all of them. Maybe skirts aren't your thing and maybe the pants aren't your thing. Maybe they're a little too casual. This little button up top jacket situation. So cute. For my soft girls out there, this is a great option. Obviously it's a lot easier to wear as a dress. It's one piece when you're in it. So cute, great for a vacation. You can use this in so many of your print settings. I'm absolutely loving this trend. Maybe it's hot where you live. This, I love this dress. It's so cute. I think it's a fun easy way to step into it. If you're not really sure that it's for you, I'm an old, so cute. Now, with all that being said, will you be wearing leopard prints this year?"," When people say that East Asia is becoming the trend setter for fashion, I don't think they're wrong because look at these pants. One of the trends that I've been smodding in China right now are the velvet pants style. And I expect this to hit mainstream fashion trends in the West very soon. And while the concept of going all out velvet might seem kind of tricky, it's actually fairly easy to style for the winter. Here's a recent photo of Rose from Blackpink here. She's pairing her black velvet pants with an oversized sweater along with some oxbirds, which is actually a very common style recipe that I've been seeing for this trend. Here's a similar look but paired with cardigans. And actually the texture of velvet itself gets kind of this luxurious, like rich old money look. The cut of the pants themselves should be wide leg or a little oversized, and you compare it with a blazer or a crop jacket for more of a professional look. In terms of colors, you can definitely go over a variety of different ways, but just make sure they're more muted or low saturation. And like I said, this trend hasn't quite arrived in the West yet, but here are a few options and where you might be able to find one."," So the first fall 2023 trend that I want to go over is cinched blazers. This is definitely one of my personal favorites. Over the last couple years we've had almost exclusively oversized blazers and that really great kind of masculine tailoring and it's such a great way to elevate your outfit. But going for something cinched is a little bit dressier. It feels a little bit more sophisticated and especially anytime you're finding something that fits you really well, that has timelessness right in its undercurrent. So you can wear that for a very long time and it becomes a little bit more resistant to trends. Another great trend for fall 2023 is off the shoulder tops and dresses and this is extending in a couple different iterations. So we're seeing really traditional off the shoulder tops but then also a slight variations that are maybe just an exaggerated boat neck. So you're showing off all of this beautiful area and then also things that are a little bit more asymmetrical. So maybe it's just a single shoulder. Another thing that we're seeing a lot for fall 2023 is silver and of course silver isn't really a trend. It's something that you can choose whether you go gold or silver in your jewelry. But because we're thinking about trends as being more available, silver jewelry is definitely becoming more prevalent right now and that's a great opportunity to add it to your wardrobe if you prefer silver or white gold, maybe even platinum. And this is also really great because it's an easy way to kind of change up your outfit. So if you're used to wearing gold like I obviously like gold as statement jewelry, you could instead just go for a silver statement earring and that's going to give you that same great impact but change it up a little bit and make it feel a little bit fresh. So with that in mind, we're also seeing a lot of great statement earrings. We're seeing those great kind of like oval shapes, a lot of great hoops like I've got today. And you can choose this in gold or silver, whatever your preference is, but really leaning into that statement effect. It's something we've seen the last couple seasons, but for fall in particular, I think it goes so great with those off the shoulder tops. So it's a really easy way to change up your wardrobe. So the next trend for fall 2023 that I want to go over is flat shoes and this much like the other things that I've mentioned, it's less about being trendy and more about availability and then also down to your styling choices. So going for a flat shoe rather than a healed shoe is a really easy way to make everything feel more current. And what's really great right now is you're finding a lot of great classic shoes in these flat styles, really cute Mary Jane's, loafers, which you know that I love. And then of course you can go for things that are really, really simple, really classic or a little bit chunkier and you have a lot of flexibility within that. So choosing something that's going to be really functional because flat shoes are really comfortable to wear. And then also in a really beautiful construction, you're going to have a piece that you can wear for a long time."," Summer fashion trends that need to happen in 2023. Y'all can disagree with me in the comments, but I think all of these should be a thing. Number one, athletic golfers skirts. I like to be girly and flirty, but I also don't want to show my down-to-ear area to the public. And every single one of these has built-in shorts. Number two, two-piece sets. It all comes as a set, so I don't even have to think of an outfit. For all my broke gals, Amazon has them for super cheap. Number three, bring back rompers. Oh, you thought this was a dress-sike? It shorts. I'm not talking about the ugly rompers we got in 2015. I'm talking about vintage, inspired rompers. There's more to be said, but I'm gonna end this video. Love you!"," right around the corner so here are some of the fashion trends you should be on the lookout for. Going back to the basics. A lot of suiting as well as that 90s model-all-duty mermaid core aesthetic for spring and summer. A lot of distressed knit, webweeds and sequins. As far as metallic's going on that silver's a heavy hitter, feel like metallics are going to shift into more of a liquidy vibe. Elevated grunge or indie sleeves, also gothic glamour. Lots of leather, whether that be motor cross or bomber jackets. Sheer and the modern feminine classic silhouettes like a slip dress, transparent mesh vibes. Exy hemlines longer than hemlines the better. Lots of Canadian tuxedos, denim on denim, cargo pants, cargo skirts, anything with a lot of pockets. And that's the trends we should be on the lookout for this season. I know that on social media can seem like trends are cycling a lot quicker than they actually are, but there are a lot of repeats from last season. Like and comment for part two of the accessories that we'll be trending and let me know in the comments which one you're most excited for.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," Let's get into it 2020 Fall Trend Predictions from Fashion Designer that also does trend forecasting. This is brought to you by Marie Claire, so this is not my findings. This is what they are saying and I'm going to tell you a little bit behind this story. Hey, starting off the forecast with everyone's a question. I think this is coming from that whole like Bridgerton vibe of like upper rich class. Like we want to go to polo races, we want like the money and that's where it's coming from the upper west side, Connecticut kind of bougie almost feeling. So that's why we are addressing my question. I will be grabbing my old American apparel riding pants. Okay, think hot pink. Everything is Barbie Corp. Everything is hot hot pink, magenta colors, everything head to toe pink vibes. We want to be Barbie's, that's why. Okay, think tank, basic white tank. Just dress up a little bit. I think this is just coming from the fact that people want minimalism and maximalism at the same time. You can dress up a white tank anyway you want. So this is pure finding. It's eclectic. I think this is coming from the fact that all sequins, all shimmer, all everything, all at once, everybody wants to be dressed up so why not do it and why not do it during the day. Good sport. This is an interesting one because I feel like a lot of tennis is being involved in this. You can obviously see in some of the adidas corsets and everything. It's very Tennessee vibe. This is just because people want to be outside. They want to include that with their life and they want to look sporty in athletic wear has always been popular. So this is something that's bringing forward to the runways. Back to basics. This trend never really goes out of style. It's just for the more minimalism girl or guy, you know, just for whoever. Okay, aviator nation is actually so funny because I just watched Hot Gun and now I feel like I just want to be a fighter pilot all the time. So this is like the whole vibe. But I think bomber jackets are just making you come back. It's just a more sporty look. It goes with the sporty trend. It's just something that you can incorporate really well. I think that like eclectic sportswear is kind of cool too. So like a sequin bomber jacket. It's awesome. But keep watching and I will show you guys how to get this on a budget."," modest fashion trends for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Part two, first up, you already know what the oversized button up. They're so hot this spring and summer, we're gonna be seeing them everywhere and they can very easily be incorporated into more modest looks. I also love this look, we're seeing a lot of this quilted fabric, especially in outerwear. We're also seeing a lot of knit, especially in tops and dresses, I love it. Again, very easy to incorporate, especially into dresses, tops, skirts, like this. So cute. And great for layering. Another one of my favorites, cargo pants. They can be a little more dressed up or down. We're gonna be seeing them everywhere and they're definitely very easy to be paired with something modest. Last and certainly not least is the Matilda Girfastetic. She has created a whole aesthetic at this point and I think it's very easy to be modest with this. There's a lot of looser fitting baggy clothes and there's lots of layering and a lot of midi and maxi dresses and skirts. Like for part three."," trending sunglasses for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. First up, we already know that Y2K inspired sunnies are super popular like these, these, or these. We're also seeing a lot of super colorful reflective Y2K inspired sunnies like these, these, and these. But if super Y2K sunnies aren't really your thing, we're seeing a lot of sunglasses with very subtle Y2K inspiration, like these, these, or these. So cute. If you're on the hunt for sunglasses, especially Y2K sunglasses, I would check out giant vintage. This is not sponsored. I've just heard they're really good. And they have a lot of cute stuff. We're also seeing a lot of this specific style of sunglasses. Very similar to the Versace sunglasses and other similar designer sunglasses. I actually just got this pair. No big deal. Basically, this slightly structured silhouette like this. Here's a stunning pair from White Fox. Like for part two.",,,,,,,,

First up we have Biker jackets. It is a staple piece very prominent for the winter months. Second we have textured metals, WGSN did say that we are going to be seeing these textured metals taking over the smooth metal for these upcoming seasons. Here's another example of this with the crinkled metals on here and lastly we have these textured earrings. Third and final trend that I have for you is quiet curves. Here in this image above me, pulled from WGSN we have this seam that goes right there which is a quiet curve. Here's another example we have the slightly curved boot with the slightly curved top. So keep an eye out for Biker jackets, textured metals, and quiet curves. Bye!"," What cool girls will be wearing for fall 2024? Part three. Mesh flats. These have been really, really popular this summer and do not put them away for fall. They do love them with track pants. If it's a little bit cooler, you can always add socks kind of like this. Maybe a little controversial, but I especially love them in red. White pants. I was told after about like August, you can't wear white anymore. This is not a real anymore. We are wearing white during fall. I'm a sucker for a monochromatic look. Also so cute paired with like a baggy knit and then a jacket. Mean come on. The cream, turtleneck with the baggy white pants and chunky shoes. Knit skirts. I mean, even better that this outfit is also better yellow, which we all love. I need to know where this skirt is from because I love the texture. I love any outfit that has a skirt match with boots. It just gives like Lore like Gilmore. And if you're not into the midi maxi length, you could always go for a mini skirt as well. Statement tights. I feel like we didn't really get into this trend as much last year. I just feel like it's an opportunity to take a monochromatic look to another level. It can make an outfit super playful at texture. You could also opt for a pattern like leopard print. Come on. This is so chic."," This is a trend for spring and summer 2024. I don't make the rules. Introducing Blokette. It's not a new style or aesthetic but I think it's going to be one that's going to be really popular this year. Pretty much the style is dressing like a bloke and then pairing it with very feminine elements. So there's like a fun juxtaposition between the styles. The formula for this aesthetic is pretty much wearing like a more boiish or like sporty shirt. Usually like a jersey or something related to a sports team and then pairing it with a more feminine bottom usually a pleated skirt or a lace skirt. I think this outfit is a great example. I love also the way she accessorizes this. I also love this styling with the jersey shirt in the pleated skirt. I really like these like proportions. Also I've seen a lot of people tying in bows. I love the proportions of this outfit as well like the shirt as a crop top and then the long white skirt and I love the little detail of the bows and the hair. I've also seen people doing a more masculine bottom and then like a more girly top. So this is a great example having like boxer shorts and then like darts paired with a crop top. Like I've been seeing a lot of girls styling these Adidas athletic shorts. I'm pairing it with a very feminine top and feminine shoe kind of is this whole aesthetic. I think like lacy tops with bows and like heels with socks. This image has been on my Pinterest board for so long by the way. I really need a great pleated skirt. Like I am so inspired by a lot of these images to make outfits like this. Honestly this outfit combo also looks really great for like when it's really hot this summer. Also I've seen a lot of people style outfits like this with the shorts paired with some type of Adidas shoe and then high white socks like this. Usually Nike or Adidas. This is like the stereotypical outvić thing when I think of this style like the pigtails, the sports shirt, the lace skirt, and then the little boots. I also love that a lot of these pieces are easy to thrift like finding athletic shirts like this shouldn't be hard at a thrift store. Also this is just to be like fun inspiration for like how to style like baggy graphic tees. So what do you guys think? Do you like this one?"," If you're a 9-5 gully with this vibe but you're struggling to find cute clothes that are comfortable and chic, here are some things that you may want to incorporate into your closet. I got to start off with the Eferless pants. You guys know how I feel about this. This is my favorite trouser for work. They come in different lengths and different colors, but these ones for spring. So cute. Let's not sleep on the Eferless shorts either. These are the mid thigh length and they're perfect for the office. Try to find a simple pair of jeans that work for you. I just love a straight leg blue pair of jeans with no grips. To go with the jeans, I love simple blouses like this. There's so many from H&M and Zara. I love the agency Blazer from Euretziat. This can take you from board meeting to dinner and drinks real quick. Instead of a T-shirt opt for a T-shirt bodysuit, this is going to be a way easier to tuck into your jeans in your trousers. Any type of Blazer vest like this is going to get you through this spring and summer season. For shoes, let's go for a platform white sneaker like this. Or step out of your comfort zone and try a ballet flat like this. Follow for more!"," Let's talk 2023, 2024 winter fashion trends that you might wanna know about. We've seen the runways, we've seen the fall fashion, so now let's see what the winter trends are gonna be. Winter trends can be so easily overshadowed by fall trends, but winter trends are so exciting, because essentially we take what works and fall, but it becomes really, really popular, and then we push it into winter, and we add all the fun winter styles that we normally have when we combine the two. So let's see what's in this year. All right, I set up my fall trends video, and that went absolutely viral, but red is the color of the season. We know that we've heard it a thousand times, but it's definitely staying for winter. You can expect it in more of the deeper reds, and also the cherry reds still, but it's for sure gonna be a trend. We've seen it stabilized, but like I mentioned in that video, and I feel like the whole fashion world is kinda talking about, is it will be more jackets, purses, handbags, shoes, same thing, you know what I mean? More of the accessory realm. Something a little more unique that I'm seeing is these big fluffy fur coats and jackets, whether it's in the detailing or all around fluffy furry jackets and coats. We're seeing them everywhere, and they are so cute. I think they're really fun, and they take a normal outfit and make it so exciting, instead of our normal basic, praying thing. So this is fun, so fashion, we love it. It's another way to wear it, and we love a full, big, fluffy furry jacket, but I think something like this is also a little more practical, where it's just a little more detailing, and it's a little bit of an easier way to move into that trend. It's really fun. Biker boots are officially here to stay, and they're becoming more and more accessible, and more and more wearable in the styles that we're seeing that are being put out, so this is very exciting. And we're seeing more versions of biker boots like this, where it's a little more clean, a little more chic, a little more easier to style, if you're not comfortable with all the buckles. So this is a great option if you wanna try them out. Honorable Bench and Off the Shroller tops are absolutely in, and they're staying for sure. We're seeing all these different styles, we can put out by so many different companies, which is very exciting. It's very chic, it's very, very winter. I really like this. Something absolutely huge that we have to talk about, it's just increasing its way into fashion as a trend for quite some time now, but the sheerling and Sherpa detailing, the sheerling and Sherpa codes, they're absolutely huge in setting this year, to the point where it's being integrated in so many different things like handbags, and shoes, they're all having these little sheerling Sherpa details. I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone buy this bag recently. These Chloe boots, I've seen so many girls wearing them, or different versions of them. They are so cute, I really like this. I think it adds a fun variety. Go part two for more.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," If you're heading to Europe for some of this year, here are my top five sandals and slide trends for 2023. So if you're still wearing the Hermes or Rahn, there's no hate, I still wear them. There's no hate, I was literally wearing them three days ago. It just screams they're outdated, they're very mainstream now. I just sort of see you as more of a follower of trends rather than like a fashion girl. So if you like the Hermes or Rahn but you want to be more sort of fashion forward, this is what I would suggest. Option one, wear your arounds that with like an oversized carpet or jean or something like this, it just looks cool. Okay so first up, if you want to stick with Hermes, just upgrade to the ship-press sandal here. I've got it in black but I think this color is beautiful, like a beige swayed. They are unbelievably comfortable. This was me yesterday, I wore them for about four hours walking around. They are so comfy, they're around the same price as the Iran as well, so I'd suggest these ones instead. Option two is the row, this is the Ginza platform sandal, these are so chic in all black or all white. I can't decide which ones I prefer but I'd probably go the black just because I could see myself getting the whites really dirty. They look so elevated, so chic with a white pan here, you could really wear them down to the pool or out straight to dinner. They are a little bit more expensive but they are such a, if you know you know, shoe, I just love them. Number three is the Saline Triumph Gladiator Sandal. Here it is in black, again it's just different and I think it's really cool for Europe, this yet. Here it is in the brown as well. I haven't seen this one around a lot as well, so I feel like it'll be a real standout. So staying within the same vein as the Saline Triumph Gladiator, here is the fisherman sandal, it's sort of a hybrid between jelly sandal and a gladiator shoe. I've heard they're very comfy and I think it looks great with like a smock dress like this. And here it is again just showing the versatility between a white dress and now just with a gene. I think I'm up to number four but here is the Saint Laurent tribute woven leather sandal here in black. This was me a couple of days ago wearing them in like that beige sand color. I was gifted these that I didn't initially lie them for my husband but I think they really are quite beautiful, quite polished. If you like that's a fear richy sort of I hate the term but it's like old money vibe. I think this really fits well with that. And I think this is even cheaper than the Hermes or so. There you go. So if I was off to Europe this is definitely the sandal I'd be getting. It's a mesh ballet flat, lots of brands are doing them but this is the Liar. I just think they are so cool. Yeah love them. It's also like a nice delicate elegant feminine option rather than like a gladiated chunky sandal. Okay I'll squeeze one more in the totem city swayed slide. It's super easy, simple and would go with absolute everything. Okay I'm running out of time that's me done. Let me know if you agree or your thoughts. Okay bye."," Hello you guys, so today we're gonna chat about spring trends for 2023 and the styles that I'm loving and the ones that I think, not so sure. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Megan, I own Newsy Mavin boutique, it's an online boutique for women, it has such cute clothes, if you guys haven't checked it out, yet please do. Alright, first up, baggy jeans. So I'm loving the high rise fit, I'm loving the just relaxed fit, it's just one of those styles that you can throw on and it looks chic with any sort of top, you can do a body suit, you can do a crop, you can do some sort of like fitted tank but something a little bit oversized up top, you can wear it with sneakers, you can do heels. This is a style that's on the site right now, if you guys want to check it out, it's the I love hygiene, it's super cute, really comfortable, has stretch, so check it out. Okay, next up, maxi skirts. I never thought that these would come back but they are back, they are back. This is an example of the style that is kind of trending right now, I am just loving the cargo style, I think it's so fun, I love how girls are styling it with just sneakers or even like new balance sneakers, I think that is so cute and it's just a casual way to like almost look like a cool girl, you know what I mean? Next up is sheer tops and dresses, I'm loving this. Cheek, yet edgy and feminine, which I love all those things. This is an example of kind of the styles that will be out, if you style some sort of simple top underneath bra let, if you even pair it with a pair of relaxed jeans and a cute heel, it's just the cutest date night look and I think that this trend is just fun and something exciting to look forward to for this spring. The next trend is sequins, which I'm kind of like there's a time and place for sequins, I'm not sure if spring is the vibe, what do you guys think? This is an example of what's trending for spring and I'm not, not sold on it. Then we have leather, I'm always for leather people, obviously not the real stuff, any sort of leather, pant, top, skirt is just fun. Add a little spice to your life ladies, a like relaxed fit leather pant, I think every woman needs that in her closet and it's just a necessity. But I'm looking forward to the skirts that are coming out, there's gonna be lots of cute like, scort leather styles, skirts, mini skirts, you gotta look out for that. What do you guys think? What trend are you guys looking forward to wearing this spring? Let me know below and also do you guys want to see another video like this? I feel like there's a few more trends I could discuss, so should we do a part two? Let me know.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," are my trend forecasts for fall 2022. Because fall tends to be colder than summer usually, I think we're going to see a lot less crop tops, a lot less shorts, t-shirts, sleeveless numbers. There's not really going to be in or trending, or very practical with the weather. Instead, I think we're going to see a lot more sweaters, long sleeves, a lot more pants and jeans, because those tend to keep you warmer. So I think that's going to be really hot this season. This one might be controversial, but I'm also predicting that we're going to start seeing some light jackets. It's going to be a big light jacket season. So hop on that trend.","Whisper failed: Failed to load audio: ffmpeg version 4.0.2 Copyright (c) 2000-2018 the FFmpeg developers

"," I've not seen one video predicting future trends of 2022 that already doesn't have trends that have blown up. People around her showing bright colours, puffer coats and uggs. We've already seen that right now, like you're really not really thinking anything new. My predictions are that chokers are gonna come back, which I hate. I think like this whole water proof, like you're on a school trip, rowing vibe is gonna be in. I think mesh and clothes with holes in are gonna be huge, like wavy are getting on the arm now. And I think like, Diamond tea like clothing is gonna come in, but not like all sparkly already have that, but like the jeans that just have laid out single diamonds everywhere.",,,,,,,,
,," My name is Kira and I'm your resident style solutionist and I'm going to show you some of the biggest trends that you're going to be seeing in 2025 and how you can wear them. Let's start off by looking at denim trends. I'm going to talk about the barrel style jean. Loose style jean that tapers in around the foot. Super versatile so you can dress these up, dress them down, they're a pair of ballet flats, they also look gorgeous with cord heels. You can wear them with tank tops, t-shirts, jumpers, jackets, wear this style now and you can also wear it all the way into spring summer as well. So it really is season-lifts like all good denim that you wear all year round. My top pick for the barrel style available on the high street right now. I bought these in the blue denim collar. I also bought them in an echo, kind of off-white collar to style for summer. Probably the biggest denim trend we're going to see this year is the return of the slim jean. Don't worry, we're not doing the like spray-don jeans. This is the slim straight, fit it to the leg and then as you taper down to the foot, it's actually a little bit looser, very much a 90 style, very, very chic and simple outfit with a white t-shirt and the bag is perfect coming into spring summer giving Rachel Green from Friends. Love this. The slim straight is versatile so you can again dress it up with heels. It looks just as good but I do think that the slim straight is perfect for casual wear. Loafers with ballet flats with slim trainers. Once again, I've done the hard work for you and I found the best slim straight jeans on the high street. I bought these jeans last year and they quickly became my most worn jeans of 2024. So easy to dress up and down. So comfortable. I'll fall break down with all of these pieces. So link to my bio. You can also comment, shop below and I'll send you the links and you can follow me for more trend reports."," slash winter fashion trends. I love. One thing I will definitely do is wearing my sweater in a different kind of way and I'm not talking about just putting it over your shoulders. I'm talking about wearing it scarf or an asymmetrical way as we can see here. Cool, so effortless. Access with outfits that are giving this kind of shapes. Long wool coat, shorts, girth and just loafers are kitten here. Let's talk about socks. I love wear socks in this kind of way. Combine different socks and we wear them with loafers, flats or kneels. We are wearing colorful tides this year but I think we don't see a lot of red tides anymore. We see more baby blue tides or white tides. So perfect for the festive season. Another shape and fashion I love. Our glass tapes as we can see here. Taylor's stuff with the belts especially obsessed with these kind of belts here. I think it looks super cool."," one step of your fashion game in 24, a lasnab, this is what all the egg girls really wear in this winter. In 2024, we're ditching the fur and we're heading straight to the teddy fabric. They find teddy hats, but it coats, and all sorts of fun and accessories that you can incorporate into your wardrobe. Another really fun trend that we're observing in winter 2024 is colored tights. So you can use this to your advantage to stay warm this winter or get super creative with your outfit or something monochromatic or add-up off color. And while we're talking about color, let's talk about the colors of the season. This winter 2024, our colors are blush pink, stage green, and this gorgeous blue. Kind of like the colors you would find in the spring, but we're incorporating them in the winter. Another fun trend that I'm loving is actually the snake print. I actually just bought snake print pants. I love them. You can do anything to snake print pants, a top, a blazer, a jacket, a belt, anything that you can incorporate into your outfit with this print will add so much life to it. Lastly, in terms of shoes, we have the foldover boot. I've seen this boot in all different styles from denim to leather, a whole bunch of different colors so you can incorporate into your outfit and add a little touch. Hope that helps. Bye!"," If you want to be the IK girl this summer with effortlessly Q outfits, this is what you need to buy. Colorful sneakers. The key to making any of these outfits so much cuter than they already are are a pair of colorful sneakers. Of course you always need your neutrals, another one of my faves, and one more. But this is where it's at. I think this is the perfect outfit recipe for any outfit this summer if you're just going around shopping, doing day-to-day stuff. Linen pants are boxer short. A plain tier tank you can even get a little fancy with an off-the-shoulder moment, paired with a good Samba. I will have a ton of these options linked on my LTK for you guys to buy, but you can look on Goat, Stockax, Farfetch, Essence, they have a ton of options."," If you like this aesthetic for spring or this, then keep watching. I have a huge naked wall with some of the pieces that we just took a look at, so let's look at them together. I'm not going to buy any black either. They're going to be so popular in spring 2024. So, whoop! I picked up this really pretty stone color. I thought that would be a really good neutral, but still a little bit of color. So picked up a simple black pair. This is just a closet that we've all looked at throughout. I liked that these were a little square-ish. The rounded ones are a little too little for me. The blue is a popular color this year, as well as stripes. It's not linen, which I wish it was. Being to pair it with a blue wash of denim. Straight lip, which are also really popular this season, and it's also a lot of this. Try everything on in the next video. The video will be too long to try everything on. We did have a linen top, though, and I'm so excited to see this. Again, we're going to pair it with some white light jeans, tuck in the front top, casual, cute, brunch fit. Allity is amazing. It's not to see through. A few skirts. I got two of them just to figure out which one will look better. This year, the Fuller A-Line skirts are really popular, which I like because it's maxi-length. This one will give a little bit more full. I don't know how I feel about these strong strings. Try it out. I'm really excited about this blazer. It's not just any blazer detail right here that kind of snatches you in on the waist. I also got a couple more jeans to try out. I'm not really sure if I like the shades, but I'm going to try them out. This is my full haul. If you guys want to see these pieces styled, come back for my next video."," are my predictions for winter street wear assurance. My name is Natalie and I'm a street wear contact creator and just lover of all things street wear. And I know no one asked me for my opinion, but here they are. First up, I think we're going to be seeing a lot of preppy layering. So thinking of button down dress shirts with sweater vest overtop or even long sleeve crew necks like this and having the dress shirt kind of hanging out the bottom with the collar popped out. Kind of going off of that trend a little bit. I've been seeing a lot of street wear looks paired with shoes like clerks or loafers and I really love that. I feel like clerks are going to be the shoe of the season. I also think it's going to be a trend to wear a really colorful winter boot. So taking uggs and getting like a lime green or a blue, I think it's going to be something we'll be seeing a ton of in streetwear. Here's another example and matching your accessories with your winter boots would be really cool. I love these pops of color. I feel like color is just taking over right now and it's not so much about the neutral outfits. I feel like a lot of people are having fun with bright colors, which is really cool for the winter too because it gets kind of dull. Last up, I think bows are going to be huge. This winter, I've been seeing a ton of girls styling ribbons onto their shoes, which is really cool. And this example here with the pop of color with the yellow. It's such a cool vibe. I also saw bows with these little shoe charms and yeah, I've just been seeing bows everywhere and I feel like people are going to be accessorizing a ton of bows into their outfits."," All right, here's another video on fall fashion trends for 2023 that you most likely already own in your closet. Starting off with the first one is a high neck or a mock neck top, as it gives a bit above. Now, if you don't own this in your closet, you probably do. As exhibited by myself, if you take a cardigan and turn it around, you have a low back and a high neck. But if you like a shorter sleeve shirt or a tank top, a lot of your tank tops already have a high neck on the back, so if you flip it around, it's perfect. And if you don't like the back of it for some reason, you're probably gonna be wearing a sweater with it now if you saw it in my last video of my lazy girl fits, I'm wearing like slouchy socks from the 90s, and I think those are low-key coming in right now, Emma Chamberlain's wearing them right here, and I really love them. I didn't own a pair, but my boyfriend has the Nike Elite socks, and so I don't know if you can see right here, but literally they're like hiding underneath because I rolled the socks to make them scrunchy. So if you have a brother or a boyfriend, still have them from them. But if you're like me, you don't really get up, you're denim easily, unless you've outgrown the size of them. And so I hoard them in my closet, and right now baggy denim is coming back in or also a folded over jean, so obviously that one you can easily do and fold over your jean. Now if you're looking for a color, I would recommend the color Frosty Blue. Obviously red is a hot topic and it's in, but red is always in for fall. Frosty Blue, I haven't really seen talked about recently, a lot of it was being around New York Fashion Week, and a lot of people were wearing that color."," some popular fashion trends that you'll definitely catch me wearing this summer. First up, we have Maxi denim skirts. Jean's go with everything, so why not turn them into a skirt? Denim skirts look so at for less, and this will be such a good addition to your basics. Next up, we have linen pants. These are such good beach pants because they're light and flowy. Just find a pair that's not so see-through, and you can wear them as regular pants on a hot summer day. Next up, we have mid-length tops. Sometimes I just don't want to show a mid-drift and I want to wear mid-wasted pants. Mid-length tops are so good for that, they make your outfits look a little bit more conservative. And in my experience, mid-length tops show your curves a lot more than crop tops. Next up, we have matching sets. Matching sets are so great because it makes you look like you put in so much effort into your outfits, but you really didn't. Next up, ballet flats. But personally, you'll only catch me wearing the pointed toe ones. I know ballet flats are like a more comfortable version of heels, but I still want my ballet flats to look elevated and dressy. Lastly, we have cargo pants. They're just so effortless, so easy to style, and the most comfortable pants ever. So what do you guys think of these trends?"," So where when you're depressed, but dressing ugly will make it worse. My groutos is a matching set, even if it's just a workout set with a cute blazer on top. Bonus points, if it's colorful. So a set in this material will instantly make you feel better, or at least cuter. I also still love a sweatshirt, tennis skirt combo. You're cozy, but you still look cool together. I also love a sun dress moment. They're easy to throw on, but you look amazing. Someone can tell you just took a three hour depression nap. I also love dresses like this. They're loose, and they don't make you clothe. But you still look cute, and it's not sweatpants. You can still wear a t-shirt and bike shorts without feeling like a slub kabobs. This is a great and easy outfit idea."," I'm a very last minute dinner, I'm gonna go do that thing where I just look in my wardrobe, find an item and try based on outfit around it because right now I'm just lost. This is the item. I just really feel like having the legs out today and I love these boots. I rarely wear them. I felt like they're a bit more like a spring summer boot, but I'm gonna make them work in winter. I actually have these leather trousers, I know I said I wanted my legs out, but this could look quite nice and tight inside the boot, but they still have to tag on because we've been looking too small, but who knows. I know it could be the day, yeah, today was not the day, but we're not gonna tell them that, we're just gonna change the front of the house. We've got this skirt that I know fits, it's very stretchy. Okay, skirt is on, let's put the boots on. I actually think it's kind of cute with it, okay, maybe not, let's change. Or I have this, oh this looks really cute. Yes, okay, I love this. The shape of the skirt is so platter, I don't feel so bad about the leather trousers, but fitting me now. I feel like we need a bit of jewelry so I'm just adding some gold earrings. I'm gonna put my camera coat on over the top, I love this outfit. Bag option. I think I need to break up the neutral tones a little bit so I might get my leather top on, very cute. Better not just gonna throw this on, both my shoulders. Okay, that was a very quick turnaround, it basically is the fit. Bye guys. Bye guys."," Here are some styles and trends that I've been pinning for fall. Everything about an all-white look to me for fall is just so classy. I'm loving these beautiful, creamy ivory sets. Ones that I can dress up and wear to work, or dress down for more casual vibe. And even having a look like this that I could dress up or dress down with the sweater vest, I just love it. I've set up before and I'll say it again. Quilting. Quilting, quilting, quilting ladies. It was all over every fashion week for this fall and then this upcoming spring. I just think it's gonna be huge and I'm loving it. We've labeled this era the dopamine style dressing, like the big colors, the maximalist thing. And I don't know. I just feel like people are starting to get a little bit tired of how bold everything is and they're kind of going back to like really pretty classic vintage patterns almost. I feel like that's why the coastal grandma thing just went crazy this past summer because I think people are tired of just like anything goes mentality. And this is very nostalgic. It just reminds me of a blanket that I used to have, you know, in my grandma's house. Even quilting pattern like this. I don't know. I feel like it's just new and innovative and I feel like people are just gonna be so creative with it and I'm here for it. I've also been in love with a loose jean and a thick cuff like this. Me, this cuff just like ties the whole outfit together. I absolutely love it. I just know those jeans are so comfortable, but she still looks so good. Like everything about this, I just love so much. I'm pinning new looks every day, so I like for part two."," Here are four fashion trends that I look forward to wearing this summer. First up, we have the draped fashion trend, which is basically when the fabric crinkles and hangs in weird places, but it's like intentional. This trend comes in long dresses, short dresses, you can keep it classy, or go the more baddie routes, you can also keep the draped stuffed more minimal. Either way, I think this trend is very cute. Next we have a maxi skirt. I love this trend because it's very size-inclusive, unlike the mini skirt. It also comes in so many different styles, so you can really make this trend your own. Next we have preppy fashion, but this time around, she quit tennis, and she joined a band. I think preppy fashion this year is going to be much more casual and more like rebellious, rather than structured. And the last trend, which is my favorite, is vacation wear as everyday wear. So basically anything crochet or knitted, flowy fabrics, bright colors, and sandal and flip flops."," Short strands for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Last year we definitely saw a lot of much longer, more bermuda-style shorts. I definitely think we're gonna keep seeing those this year. However, I know that they're not everybody's thing. You can definitely still be very on trend with denim shorts without going over the top with something super long or super baggy if that's not your thing. Maybe with something more like this, a little shorter, a little more fitted, something like this, this, or definitely something like this. These are much more fitted and just a little bit longer than regular shorts, but so cute. And like this. Or like these. There we go. We are loving cargo pants right now. So it should come as no surprise that we're gonna be seeing a lot of cargo or carpenter-style shorts. I think we're gonna be seeing this specific pair of ducky shorts everywhere. Like for part 2.",,,,,,,,
,," I'm trends we're absolutely doing this spring. Cool trousers, I am obsessed with all pattern pants right now, and we will be seeing these all spring. And I am definitely here for it. We're also going to be seeing wrap necklaces everywhere. And the spring trend will definitely go into summer. Boxers as shorts. We've been seeing this trend for a while now, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Denim tops will be everywhere. This is definitely a cool girl trend, and I think it's great. We're also going to be seeing a ton of suede. I think this is such a good transitional piece, and it's literally timeless. I think it's like for the next part."," Let's talk winter fashion trends. We're gonna be seeing a ton of fair- Isle sweaters. That whole contrast knit type of sweater that you see for all pre-ski, that is the vibe. There's such a fun way to add a statement piece into your winter wardrobe. You can go for something classic like this or something playful with like a fun shape like these butterflies. I've also been seeing a lot of bows and hearts. Also for shoes, we're gonna see a lot of over the knee and knee-high boots. These kinds of higher boots are perfect for styling something that's a little bit shorter, like a mini skirt, dress, or blazer. Also, these kind of slouchy boots are gonna be really popular. And another example. We're also seeing Pontches, Capes, and Shals. These give such a cozy lived-in look, very good for layering. And I feel like a cape can be made to look very classy. This is definitely giving Blair Waldorf. We're also gonna be seeing a lot more cropped for jackets, mostly in neutral colors. Obviously the longer for jackets aren't going anywhere either, but we used to save them for our fancy nights out and now we're seeing them a lot more dressed down with like a jeans and sneaker. Also, these little hats and headbands that match the faux fur. These are gonna be big for winter. We're still loving a chunky pattern scarf. A little less like this and a little more like this. Not quite so in your face with color. Then also, pops of light blue. This color blue is gonna be huge winter accessories. Let me know what you thought about these trends."," What cool girls be wearing for winter? 2024, part three. Fur trimmed coats. The style elevates any outfit and gives me like old money vibes. Obsessed with the fur trim on this leather jacket, they'll have any trend of that place around with texture, so cute. Cots with built-in scarves, what a genius design. Been seeing this particular style of coat everywhere. The style looked me worn in so many different ways, but I really like this mergeriscy outfit with the brown trousers and then the pointed flats. Looks so good paired with denim and sneakers. The built-in scarf also looks really good with a cropped coat, healed loafers. Loafers went from being a trend to a colossus table over the past few years, but were mixed it up a little bit by adding a heel. It adds a bit more femininity to the style. It's so nicely with the tailored suit sets, especially the ones with the midi skirts. And if you don't like the loafers with the heel, you can also go for a chunky loafer, which will still give you some added height. Belted blazers. Not only is the belt an added accessory, but then it also makes the blazer just a little bit more flattering. I really like this outfit with the tail of the belt left out. The style also looks really good with a belt with a larger buckle obsessed with the dress blazer combo."," 2024 Eurogirl Summer outfit ideas, let's get into it. I'll go for your handbags and totes are an absolute essential I am obsessed with these from Pauline. Slip dresses are absolutely added to my packing list. I promise you, yellow is the color of the summer. Even this yellow blazer looked so cool. I know we saw Dark Cherry Red become such a fashion favorite over winter and spring, but transition it to strawberry red or an orangey red over summer. If you can't go wrong with a classic pair of denim, you'll always recommend packing simplistic body suits and basic tanks. Just know that if you have a day where you're seeing cathedrals or churches, you're going to be asked to cover your shoulders so always bring along a little shawl or cardigan. Stripes are always in and maxi dresses are always a good staple to have. A classic pair of sunnies and a statement black or brown bell are the accessories of choice.

Bye."," I'm not talking about micro trends, but here are some cute pieces and outfits that I'm really excited to wear this spring. First up, knit vests. I am loving everything about this. These knit ones are really cute, especially in this heavy gray color. Impaired with the white, fresh, it's light, and it's really sexy with this little peek of skin, but it's not too much. It's not like a crop top, you know? I think a denim vest like this could also be really cute, but what do you guys think? Next, cardigans like this. This looks effortless in the best way. It's oversized, it's slouchy, but again, you still get a peek at the silhouette. So it doesn't feel like bulky or boxy. I love light knits in the spring. It's like a touch of warmth, but not too much. Next, interesting tube tops. We saw this last year, and honestly, I feel like I didn't get enough of it. So we're gonna keep it going this year. This is very much aligning with like the little top-naked bottoms format. Let me just say this is such a flattering shape. I have an outfit just like this, but instead of a dark top, it's with a light top and light bottom. Easily one of my favorite looks last year. So I'm thinking I want a black one now, and maybe some other colors too. Next, backless tops and outfits. I work hard on this back, and I want it out. It's such a little peek-a-boo moment. You take any cute outfit and then make it backless. Now people will look at that outfit and say, oh, she really has taste. Give it to me. Next little two-piece sets like this. Not necessarily in black, but like in a pretty periwinkle blue, maybe even a pale yellow. We know that a matching set is key to making you look put together. So I feel like something like this, or even a pants version like this, with some cute heels, a cute back. It's like a cheat code for a little dinner outfit, a party, whatever. You're gonna look so cute. I can keep going, but I'll end on belts. Especially belts with basic, low effort foundation. Something about a belt with a nice white t-shirt and a cute pair of jeans, off through the 90s supermodel. Immediately. I have unfortunately under utilized belts in the past, but no more. You are going to catch me and looks like this immediately. Lastly, I'll say that with all of these, we will be adding color. Let me know what you're excited to wear this spring."," This is what's gonna be trending this winter from a fashion stylist. Lofas were big last year and I definitely think they're gonna continue into this season. And on the topic of shoes, I feel like we're gonna see lots of new hybrids, especially like gumboot new hybrids. I'm actually obsessed with this trend and I think they are so cute. Now, the one that was around last season, I definitely think blazes will stay in trend this season as well. This is one I've already seen haves around Melbourne, but Maxi skirts, especially Denna Maxi skirts. They have already been big this year and I think the trend will definitely continue on into the colder seasons. I definitely feel like we're gonna see lots of blazes and hoody combos as well. I think this trend is so cute and a little way to kind of dress down your outfit without dressing it down, if that makes sense. This looks classy and chic. Honkiniets, I feel like are also gonna be huge this year. I think we'll definitely be seeing a lot of these. Let me know your favourite winter fashion trends in the comments and what you're excited to see this year from winter fashion."," Autumn trends you can start wearing now. The first is a cinched in blazer. On a recent reel I spoke about the changes in the shape of blazers and this cinched in style is going to be big for this season. pair with wide leg trousers and sandals or an a-line skirt to start wearing now. Another big trend for the new season will come as no surprise and that is leather or faux leather. Although these come round every year, they're going to have a particular spot like moment this autumn. I actually love leather styled in a more summary way, so pair with a t-shirt and some sandals for night out outfit. Finally, this buttery shade is going to be big for the new season. Go all out head to toe like I've done with this matching suit and tonal bag or you can do it a little bit more casually too. Choose one piece in this tone like the trousers and dress them down by using tan shades and basics like this tank top."," We're talking about five summer trends that we were seeing this season. First off, we are seeing a lot of sheer see-through dresses. And these are so cute on vacation, especially with the bikini underneath them. Next is Sequins in a beachy setting as seen on Sophia. Sequins can be so fun as a cover-up for a bikini. Also for a night out, and this trend is just so fun. And the colors of this summer are definitely yellow and orange. This orange so excited, so gorgeous, especially for a vacation. Last for jewelry, we have been seeing lots of color. And what's trending is just a more is more vibe."," 2023 styles and trends that you should or shouldn't be wearing and you want to wear the trend. I'm going to help you wear the trend and show you what to wear and what to wear with it to allow you to wear the trend. Does that make sense? It will in a second if it doesn't yet. So thank you so much. Like that just makes me so happy. It makes me want to keep going. So thank you. Start off with this one here. I love a denim short shirt boot combo. Like I think it's so fun for spring and summer. I love how she has it tucked one side in and one side left out. That's my jam. That's what I do all the time. It just helps conceal at a belt too. So that will help with your waist as well. Just kind of helps with the concealing. And then too, if you're still uncomfortable, these are going to be your new best friend. I'm about to invest in another pair. They're amazing. I wear them under a lot of pants that I have. They are awesome. And if you're not interested in a thong, they have briefs. They have regular coverage. You know all the things. Another thing that's going to help you with those panties or without pleats pleats pleats pleats. If you get any kind of pant like this, make sure it has pleats in it. Just got these in actually from Amazon. They're in my Amazon storefront and they are amazing. And they are so flattering. I had them on in one of my latest, uh, trauma videos. I'll tag it below too if you missed it so you can see them on. Here's these by that brand too. I've not tried these personally, but if there is good as the ones before, the same brand, then I'm a huge fan. This denim shorts boot combo like, you know, I tell you, I'm obsessed. But I sometimes can't wear short shorts. So my opinion just makes my legs look bigger. So I like to do a black skirt. So here's this one on Amazon I found. I love the crisscross detail. Very flattering. Actually have this one from H&M and it is one of my go-toes. So I will recreate that exact outfit, but with a skirt. I feel like it covers my legs more, kind of insecure about my legs. So yeah, win win. These are really popular. These tops that either clasp or tie in the front. So it kind of leaves you gaping just a little bit. So I'm going to show you how you can wear this trend and not show scamp. Pending on how tan or what color the top is and all of that you can do. These are my favorite body suits from Abercrombia have them in every color that they are offered in. I also have this color too. I wear them under everything. Any of my sheer stuff, anything like that that ties in the front, you can't even tell that you're wearing it. This trend, I just came across this and I wasn't even looking for it, but this asymmetrical skirt. I'm intrigued. I found this one on Amazon and I'll have to report back because I'm going to order it. Another way to wear the shorts and feel concealed, especially going into spring, is a sheer tight. These will be your new best friend. These are from Spanx. You'll love them. Hope that was helpful. I'm already out of time. I was going to do more so stay tuned."," I filter pick my outfit, let's go. Wait, this isn't bad. Okay, let's do this. That filter kept changing, so I had to take it off. But black jeans, I have my Abercromby jeans. They are not as ripped as those, but they do have some little in the tears, so these will work. Petition for this to be the outfit? No, I'm just kidding. Okay, so to me, it looked like it was a pale pink sweater or like almost like a Beige pink. So let me see if I have one of my closet. Wait, I actually think this matches it super close. Cute so far. I only own one black belt and I can't find it, so we're just gonna have to skip the belt, which is fine. I don't usually wear a belt anyway, so let's get shoes. The filter showed a mustard color converse. I don't own any shoe in that color, so we're just gonna go with these converse. Really, I'm using any excuse to wear these because I love them, so let's put them on. This is so cute. Perfect, went to your outfit. Now let's get a bag. I don't think the filter showed a bag, but let's just get one to complete the outfit. I'm making this little cream bag just because it goes with everything. And here's the final look. What's we think? See you tomorrow."," So I've cried a lot today, so we're gonna get dressed to hopefully, you know, feel better. I just got this hoodie and it says chew quietly on it, which is something I live by, so let's style it. It's also cold today, which is kind of cool. This is gonna be our first layer. Here she is. I love this dress. I'm already feeling a little bit happier, which is good. Let's put on the hoodie now. I know this is kind of a weird combo, but I feel like it's something Bella Hadid would do. Cute. This is so wrinkly, but I'm not fixing it. Oh, I don't mind it. It's kind of funky. I kind of like this vibe. I just love how ridiculous the toes are of these. I like this. I love this off-woink headband. That could be fun. No, I'm sorry you had to see that. Okay, this was a mask, but so am I. So I love you guys. Bye."," 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major. Part two. First up we have wrap sunnies. All they definitely can be more in the statement. We're seeing a lot like this that are just a bit more casual and wearable. I think they're so cute. Next up linen pants like this, this or this. And honestly just a lot of linen in general. I am obsessed with this look. We're still seeing a lot of midi and maxi dresses, especially sleeky dresses. We're seeing a lot of stripes this season. A lot of pinstripes like this, this or this. And I'm especially seeing a lot of striped headbands. And still seeing a lot of the cloth headbands in general. We're still seeing a lot of platform shoes. Really channeling from that late 90s early 2000s fashion. Especially seeing a lot of platform slides and platform flip-flops. And lots of two nips or longer tops. Like for part three."," Spring and Summer 2022 fashion trends. Whether you love it or hate it, low-rise jeans are on their way back in. And so are mid-rise, which I think are a lot more wearable. I can't lie, I hated it at first, but it's kinda growing on me. We've been so used to crop tops, but with the return of lower-rise jeans, we're also gonna be seeing a lot more longer shirts. Another surprising return at the ballet flats. And they don't have to be like the typical ballet flat like the ones I just showed. These follow a lot of current trends. Tube tops are definitely gonna have their moment this spring and summer. We're gonna be seeing a lot of please-safe fabric. And we're already seeing it a lot in sets, I love it. We're gonna be seeing a lot of the sweetheart neckline, even a bit more subtly like this, or this. We're also starting to see a lot more flared or bell sleeves. Like for part two.",,,,,,,,
,," predictions based on the fall winter 2025 runways. The first is offbeat jewelry. We saw Polaroid broaches at Moschino and statement necklaces atop knitwear at Prada and not wait to see how this gets DIY'd. Fur by far has been the most dominating trend across the board for fall winter, specifically manifesting in skirts of all colors of all lengths. This one is really interesting because fur it feels very familiar but we don't necessarily see it worn as skirts. There were also a few slit skirts that I saw this season. Just interesting coincidence. One of my favorite emerging trends hair being used almost in place of fur. This is an explosion of texture of mystery. The little dash of spooky and grotesque. This is one to watch. This is one that I see only growing from here. An increased appetite for nostalgia. Deorbaugh, Goliano, Gidorio T-shirts. At McQueen, Sean McGurray introduced the skull print in tops and in the original skull scarf. Super smart move on his part in my opinion. And of course the long awaited return of the Chloe Paddington, which is a trend prediction I reported on almost four years ago. In addition to nostalgia in general being the overarching trend that is defining the 2020s. This is around the topic of the Chloe Paddington. The way these are styled. I saw a few of these extra large rabbit feet or like animal tail key chains being worn as a scarf as a dress adormant, a back charm. You can get these for super cheap on Etsy. Another one to definitely look out for. This is going to be a styling moment for the back half of the year. Also seeing a lot of cuddly childlike motifs and accessories. Like these giant doll bag charms at Fendi. Bunny clutches and stole that Simone Rocha and plushy animal key chains at coach. In addition to Sandy Lang's use of like polypocket miniatures and coperny unveiling the tomogadji swipe bag. All of these are living under that same nostalgic umbrella to me. This new take on waist list skirts almost like a paper bag waist at product. Tori birch something similar last season. So I've got my eye on this one. Padlock's like really heavy metals. This one feels really grounding really protective. I know these are heavy. This is another great DIY idea. Finally crushed colorful velvet. A lot of the times we associate velvet with like black or really dark purple. But so quite a bit of color using this fabrication which is not an easy thing to wear. I love that there was so much fun on the runway this season. Let me know your favorites and if you wear any."," I have a degree in fashion. Let's talk about the winter fashion trends part two. We all know Burgundy is gonna be the color of the season, but the second trendiest color is gonna be navy. Navy is gonna be so popular for this winter. We are gonna see it in codes, in pants, in sweaters, monochromatic navy blue outfits are gonna be so trendy. And it is definitely gonna be the new black for the season. Fofur is gonna be so big this winter. Fofur was definitely super trendy last year as well. And we saw a big trend with the mob wife aesthetic that is definitely still gonna be around this year. But I feel like this year is gonna be bigger. And not only we are gonna see jaggeds, we are gonna see fofur with everything. With shoes, hats, gloves, this is probably my favorite trend. And the trend that I'm most excited to wear this winter. The shoes that we are gonna see the most this winter are gonna be the moon boots. And this year we are gonna see more colorful ones. I'm seeing a lot of red, but also as you can see here, pink, yellow, and also these ones that are a little fuzzy. But of course the classic beige, white, and black are still gonna be super trendy. Ag is probably gonna be the second shoe that we are gonna see the most this winter. Ags I feel like are kinda becoming a timeless piece. Maybe particular styles are trendy, like maybe the platforms or the testmans. And maybe the style that I'm seeing the most this year are the minis. Next are the reading glasses. If you have not seen this Mimium glasses yet, where have you been hiding? These are so trendy, it's kind of annoying at this point, but honestly I get it. I feel like they look amazing on everyone. Burgundy is the color of the season, and we are of course gonna see a lot of burgundy tights. Style with a fur fur jacket and with burgundy shoes. So cute. But not only burgundy, we are gonna see color tights a lot. In blue, by the way, iconic, pink, white, green, yellow, green, gray, like honestly any color that you can imagine, people are gonna wear, which I think is super cute."," This is my cool girl fashion inspiration board for when you're traveling or when you're thinking about planning your outfits. These are the things that I'm excited for this year. A lot of neutrals, but cool elements that tie things together, different shapes, great shoes. Let's go through them. First and always is the double denim Canadian texito. It can be like really streamlined. Or I also like these new shapes for the denim jacket. I like this one as a product jacket. But the buttons all the way down up. I think it's really cool. Streamline can be skinny pants, wide leg pants, any kind of way. I think it's cool, but I think the more buttoned up it is. Or if you layer of like a white t-shirt school. The oversized blazer, in my opinion, is always here to stay. But it's so diverse. You can wear it with jeans. I really like this look with the Adidas pants, a mini skirt, or like with your straight leg denim. Always super cool. I love thrifting them. So now this one is about wide leg pants. Can't go wrong with the wide leg pants with a cardigan, with the denim wide leg pants, the Adidas pants. I think these are all really cool looks. They're so effortless, super easy, and nothing is uncomfortable. It's all about comfort and style and they love it. The mini skirt can be a trickier look, especially here. It's still very cold out, but I love it style this way. This is like a mini dress. And looking at most of them, they are paired with either ballet flats or kitten heel. And we have the Mary Jane Barely flat, or the pointed toe, I think is really cool. Just makes it a little bit more relaxed than wearing it with like a heel or a booty, or something like that. On the opposite of the mini skirt is the long skirt. I love this look with the tie. I have a little dress I wanna wear. Like that, I think that's very cool. This a-line dress kind of going on that kind of dramatic skirt trend that we're seeing. I'm not gonna be wearing a tool by a little wear a-line knit though. Long mini skirt is still very fashionable for spring in my opinion, and you could do it. Like this with like a belt is really cute in a t-shirt."," But cool girls will be wearing for spring 2024. Part 3. Statement belts. I feel like belts were out for so, so long, like even the most basic of ones. But this year's statement belts are coming in. This one is gorgeous. Honestly, don't know why we ever stopped wearing these because they're a great way to take a very basic outfit and instantly elevate it. And there's so many different styles. So you can go for more of like a simple one like this. Or pick about that is a little bit more on the funky side. Love this. Barrel jeans. You either love these or hate these. I personally think they're very, very flattering. We've really been into really baggy, jean styles. But this one has a baggy effect, but since it kind of meets together at the bottom, it's a little bit more flattering. I think they look even better with the heel. I'm going to need a pair of ASAP. All the cool girls will be still wearing their mini skirts, even at plus if it's a score, because then it's even more comfortable. We're also specifically going to be seeing more mini skirts with built-in belts, which I think is genius. And sunglasses with colored lenses. Such a great way to bury easily out of pop of color to your outfit. Yellow lenses are my personal favorite. I think they're so chic and timeless. Also really love the gray greening."," You do not need to buy new clothes every year. This is everything you need for spring. Do you remember how the skirt had everyone in a chokehold last summer? Bring it out again, honey. Do a little long sleeve shirt with a leather jacket on top. Still stay warm. And if you still haven't found your favorite leather jacket, I bought this last year and I'm still recommending it. It's pretty affordable and it fits so well. This is from the men's section at H&M. I'm also loving a brown leather jacket right now. This is the time to bring a light wash jeans back out. Also really like like the mid to light wash. The Alia from Denim Forum is perfect. It's giving fresh, it's giving light. It's giving spring. Also loving this trench, the perfect transitional coat. They have this one at Aritzia and it's perfect. Speaking of coats at Aritzia, I'm dying over this one. The structure, the color, everything about it, I love. We also just need some light cardigan sweaters. I like a more structured style, you can dress it up or down. And these ones from Uniclo are just perfect. The fit, the quality, and also only $60. While you're at it, they have the perfect t-shirt. So if you need a roundup with your black, white, and gray, Uniclo. Do you remember those linen pants that you bought last year? Pair it with a button up top or you can do a sweater. Also just a great way to add some color into your outfit. Loving this baby blue right now and it's a timeless color. Which brings me to the button up top. You can wear it open, you can wear it buttoned up. We all need this, it's the perfect base layer. Again, and again, also slay. Like this just looks so chic and 90s, love it. The linen pant with the blue, I'm just, I'm loving this color combination. Oh you thought I was gonna make you spend a lot of money. No, I'm sorry, old Navy. These are real linen blend, $45. 30% off. Like for part two."," coming and I think that winter trends really get overshadowed by the fall because people just get bored with the cold weather outfits and they just start adding a boring puffer on top but winter trends have a lot to offer. There's a lot you can do so let's go through a few and spell examples. The whole ski lodge kind of style has become a major trend over the past couple of winters. I think this is a really good example of it. She's obviously not about to go skiing but she's got her base layer on, a nice cozy sweater and the moon boots are obviously a really big winter trend. The rolls are probably not going skiing but you can tell they're in some kind of a wintery wonderland lodge and lots of fur, the fun little hats, the sunglasses. I mean I I really like this and here's another example a little bit more casual and another one for good measure. Fur is a classic winter staple. I do feel like it's becoming more trendy to wear the big fur faux coats but I do think these are generally timeless pieces. This is my favorite example. I think this coat is so so cute. And another one in a more brown kind of tone. Winter philosophy is just add tights. I honestly think tights can make an outfit. This is an example of that and if you get fleece line tights I'm not kidding. You will probably be sweating your ass off if you walk anywhere. They insulate you so well. I'm also a huge fan of winter white outfits so basically a full kind of off white outfit. I think it's so chic and classy for the winter time. For example, and of course we can't talk about winter time without the ug trend. The ugs are here. They're here to stay. The platforms, the non-platforms, they're all trending. And if your style leans a bit more street style here's an example of that winter white fit for you. Finally this is nothing to do with clothes but we can't underestimate the power of a cute hair style to make an outfit when your whole outfit is literally just outerwear. This would be a super boring picture if her hair wasn't in a braid in my opinion. This is just a messy bun but otherwise her hair would be covering her earrings and the sides of her glasses so the accessories would be totally lost in this outfit. Can't go wrong with a claw clip situation either. Same deal with the glasses and earrings. They would be covered otherwise. I also think this is a super cute option. And that is all. Let me know if you want more of these. This is all saved on my Pinterest under winter 2023."," I'm declaring summer over. It's time for fall. I love fall fashion. I dress my best in the fall. I love layering. I love sweaters. So I'm getting excited for the upcoming season and I thought I would make this video on just what I think is to come for fall fashion. My first trend that I think is going to be happening is the color charcoal gray. I mean, I love shades of gray, but I think charcoal gray is going to be like the new black. I feel like last winter it was a lot of browns. Which I loved and I was so obsessed with like brown is the new black, but I think this season it's going to be all about gray. I even love a hair paired with like the khaki pants. I think that just looks so chic, so cute, but very easy and very minimal. Even this all gray outfit, I love it. It's super easy, super chic, and I think if you have enough black, gray, khaki, white pieces that you can mix and match nearly everything. So I think it's a really seamless add-in to your wardrobe. The next trend I don't want to be canceled, but I'm going to say it's skinny jeans are coming back. They are. It's inevitable. Be ready for it. But I personally don't like how skinny jeans look on me if I wear it with a short shoe. Like I it just doesn't look good on my proportions. Maybe that's a me thing, but I think paired with like a tall boot is really, really chic and I would wear it this way. Or if you're not ready for skinny jeans, keep your boyfriend jeans and pair it with a tall boot. That's also really chic. This is an old photo of Gigi Hadid, but even if just like a legging with a tall boot, chic, but still tight to the skin, not your usual baggy jeans. And this last trend I think is a personal thing to me, but I just love these boots that go right below your calf that you wear over your jeans or over, you know, whatever pant you want to pair it with. I don't know why it just reminds me of like old tumbler in spare photos I would look at. I think it's really elevated if you get a good pair or really chic pair. I actually got one from Steve Madden I haven't gotten them yet, but once I do, maybe I could show like how I would wear them. Even these are more fun. They're definitely sparkly and they add something different. I feel like Carrie Bradshaw would wear something like this like a super basic outfit with a fun boot. But yeah, these are my trends for fall 2023."," Recalling it, Summary 2023 is all about the Expose Bra. Don't believe us. You only need to take a brief glimpse at recent recarpits to see a host of Hollywood A-Listers championing the look. The very opposite of a wardrobe malfunction, there is nothing accidental about this lingerie reveal. Instead, repositioning the idea that an Expose Bra is anything to be embarrassed about. One scene as the ultimate fashion faux pas, the Expose Bra is the latest underwear as outerwear trend taking over."," Okay, hi guys. I really want to start doing outfit of the day video. So I'm gonna make a series of all my spring outfits. Today I'm going to the grocery store and then to a coffee shop to do work. So my ringies, aloe yoga, brown leggings. If there was like one October set that I could wear forever, it would be this like air lift fabrics. And my ringies, they have the loose foothand at the bottom. I think they would be like way more fur-toler. But I'm not and then I'm wearing this rib-leaf yours of our sports bra. I wanted to layer the bronze sports bra over this. I love that layered look. So you don't have to style something else like that because it didn't work with this. And then I'm wearing this little aloe yoga cardigan. And then my sneakers, sneakers, or a vey house. They're like the dad ones. I honestly forgot I had these and they're super neutral and I love them. But I broke the back of this one. So I need to get it fixed. And then my sunglasses, I got them in Aspen, I'll put the brand in the caption."," I found the perfect basics, you guys are gonna thank me later. This black crop top, I mean, come on. Is this not the best one you've ever seen? It literally feels like butter and it just cleans to all the right places. It's perfect. This may be the prettiest top I've ever put on my body because of this. Is that not the best ever? And they have it in a long sleeve body suit. Impactable. And speaking of body suits, this long sleeve gray one, I don't even have to wear a bra. I'm gonna show some bonus items, because why not? Like these overalls, fantastic. This maroon coat is everything to me. I'm obsessed with it. It's literally the perfect light jacket. And surprise, everything's just fantastic following. Don't forget to use my coat. Okay, bye."," No, because I actually have somewhere to go today. Get ready with me to go in a coffee day. This is gonna sound really off, but I really wanted to style my outfit based on these fake Chanel tides with like warmers. So I'm thinking either a skirt or like a dress. So I just got these shorts from Revolve and I really wanted them to look cute, but I don't know how they're supposed to fit. Like the crotch area is like too low like this and then it's just new. I'm wanting to style this skirt for fall. So here we go. It's try to what I'm saying. It looks so cute, but I'm gonna have time to clean it so I just all wear something else and this top is my go-to with this skirt. I've already styled it differently with knee high boots. So like it'll be same, same with different. The top is on and she's looking cute. I'm thinking like just go all nude with this look. So I'm gonna do these vintage heels that I found on posh mark that are already falling apart, but whatever. I scratch all of that because I really am feeling the sweater. So I'm just gonna hurry up and try and clean this off before I leave. I really wanted something pink down here. So I just added this like random this whole pink in my bag with my favorite little clog lip and some jewelry, my favorite bracelet, my favorite accessory, my engagement ring. Anyway, should I do a chain belt with this outfit? Like would it be too much? So this is an actual chain belt and then this is actually just a necklace that I didn't like make work. I decided to go with this because the other one like there was way too much going on, but this is the final outfit."," Spring and Summer 2022 fashion trends from, you already know, a fashion major. Part 2. We already know about low-rise jeans, but are you ready for? Low-rise and mid-rise skirts. We're also going to be seeing a lot of midi and maxi skirts, especially in knit. We've already been seeing a lot of this specific neckline. We're going to be seeing it incorporated into much more casual pieces. Some of our favorite staples are going to be really big this season, like trousers, a good-o button up, and yes, the blazer, especially the blazer dress combo. We're also going to be seeing a lot of cropped blazer sets, both in skirts and with pants. Very similar to the police say, we're going to be seeing a lot of the crinkle or textured fabric, and a lot of ruffles like this. Also, this pale yellow color is just, I think it's going to be huge this spring and summer. Like for Part 3."," Hi guys, coming on here really quick with a get ready with me. I'm going to brunch with my husband and son in the city and I wanted to show you what I put together starting off with these jeans from Zara they're called the Marine Street and I'm gonna do a tuck as usual to Polish up the look and the accessories for today are just some bracelets two necklaces that I'm layering together. For sneakers I'm going to dress down the look a little bit with a pair of some old tucks just classic chuck tailors and so to play off of the blush top I'm going to do a darker blush trench. And this is the look so comfortable so easy, chic, effortless happy Sunday guys. Bye",,,,,,,,
,," my favorite fashion trends for spring 2025. Alcatal is definitely having a little comeback moment. I really love how playful this is without adding too much of pattern because I really don't like patterns on myself. I also love the polka-dot nails everyone has been getting. There's a lot of articles saying that plaid is also a trend. Really, I'm not a very big fan of this but I think it's really, really beautiful for this and skirts. Take it out to a little something to the outfits. Powder paint also having its comeback just reminds me the beginnings of Glossier. This is my favorite color in the entire world. It feels so innocent and sweet while not being too much. Me personally, it's just a perfect shade of pink. And has also been saying boho. What are these runway pictures? Storm Pinterest a lot like me. You've probably seen these and I just think they're really, really iconic. I'm really happy to see this trend. Though this also has happened before. I just really feel like it's very much a 20 to 10s revival kind of theme going on. Last trend that I like that I found a lot is Coastal grandma preppy and then also functional outerwear and combination with that. Which I think is a really, really great trend. It was almost impossible to find real life inspiration for that. This is a PSA. Please start wearing functional jackets and make outfits with them. Just things that work in the brain. I need to up."," fall 2024 fashion trends coming. I was scaredly accurate with that trend video so here I have 1 to 24 fashion trends coming from a fashion student that said he's trends. As you guys know I have my handy dini notebook so let's get started so the first thing is actually scarf necklines. You'll see this this has been really popular this fall in like the past summer so we're transferring that to the winter let me show you. This really gives what this winter is going to be it like it's really giving like old money like Eastern America like New York Manhattan like all like any stuff. I like this is so cute it is a scarf neckline so it comes with like a scarf built in and I just think that's so unique and like I haven't seen this style in just a long long time. Another big thing is going to be like boho countryside type style so jeans boots and sweater but the sweaters were most likely have like fringe or embroidery. Something really unique um this kind of like stems from like belly did being like a little like country like horseback rider you know what I mean so that kind of like what it reminds me of so I'm gonna show you guys some examples. Like this jacket it's like boho country so I almost don't look at her outfit we're looking at the jacket but yeah it's like unique in its own ways adding like a different touch to the usual trench coat. I feel like this is like another really good example just the way things are laying the colors this is very boho-esque. Her shirt is like really cute paired with that blazer like I feel like this is just so winter boho countryside type vibe. Y'all are gonna hate me but another trend is minimalist accessories. I know y'all have been on the big chunky jewelry but minimalist accessories are coming back. I just think it's like a reflection of the economy right now like nobody wants to spend money on big like chunky pieces that cost a lot of money and if you do buy like big chunky pieces they're gonna turn it really easily so people are spending more money for a minimalist piece of jewelry or a belt that's actually gonna last a longer period of time. You know what I mean? So tiny belts, little watches, dainty neckels, dinky bracelets, things like that. The leather gloves are also gonna be back in. They're just like cool little tiny additions that you can add to your closet that could last like a long period of time. That is like the main goal of this trend I guess you can say sunglasses are back. I don't think they have ever left but they're back. This was actually like taken on a runaway. I think this is Miumoo. I'm not too sure. Earing dainty earrings. You have like a earring stack but they are gonna be dainty. There might be like one or two that are chunky but the rest are dainty. Next up there's going to be a choice in fabric and how likes are ended up fabrics are made which is sway, cordway, and velvet. Those are usually thicker types of fabric. They feel nice, they feel expensive but you can get them for cheap to be honest so that's why that you're going to be trending. I feel like you'll see them a lot in jackets in purses. Maybe shoes too. You're going to see them a lot in blazers. This whole outfit is so cute. This is swayed in blue. Brown and blue go so good together. I feel like that's going to be a color combination that you guys see a lot this winter. I know y'all have been seeing them but surely maxing coats. These are going to dominate life. It's literally dominating my Instagram feed. I need one at this point. These. If you want it to be unique I say you can get the cow one, the cow-fresored one because it's like a micro trend. Like only like a few people are doing it. Like really like the fashion people are doing the cow prints but it isn't that people are mostly doing browns, whites, and grays or like animal print. Another thing that's going to be trending this winter is brown. We know it. We love it. Chocolate brown is going to be everywhere this winter. Like I said it's going to be in the coats especially in jeans too. I can see that a lot but her pants or her boots those are cool as hell. Animal prints are the new neutral. I'm getting used to it. I literally set that in my last video in the video I stitched. Animal prints are not going away for a long time. I don't know what it is about animal prints but they're going to be here. Like I said they're on the long maxi coats because the what I find interesting is how people style them. I think they're really nice on the jeans, on the belts. You're not a bag but like she's using the brown like she's very trendy and I think I don't know if your shirt is blue or white if that's like a very light blue or if it's white. I don't know but her fit is cute. Like she looks really cute with the brown door. She's eating. If you wanted to do something edgy you should do this. I think this would be really cute for new years. Like with this fructly red pants and the coat and the black top like this is actually really cute. This is giving you anything else. I didn't know that but yeah. Speaking of red, wine red is in this winter and actually I see this top on sheen in Amazon so that's where you can get this top. I love this top but yeah wine red. I love it when people style the colors in unique ways so I love to see it in like tights and like shoes and stuff rather than it being like the shirt or the pant you know what I mean? So this is really cute. Wine red obviously goes really well with gray so wearing something like this eats. It also goes really well with cream. I love love love love cream and red together. Like this just looks so classy and elegant and if you want to give like that rich like sultry type of vibe I would wear like I offer like this. Anyway these are my bijections for winter 2020s to wait for let me know if you guys think I'm right and if you guys would wear any of these things that I listed in you. Thank you. Please like and follow my channel and also follow my Instagram if you want to because we don't know what's going to happen with 6 o'clock. So yeah thank you bye."," but cool girls will be wearing for winter 2024. Colorless jackets. Honestly, it was unsure about this trend at first, but I actually really like it. I think it adds a little bit of a cleaner look to the jacket. So cute with trousers and just a basic tee. Obsessed with how it looks with the turtle neck, Ella Clawba's, not only are they cute, but they're also very functional. Add such an easy fun layer. You can even go the extra mile and layer it with a baseball cap. Such a great way to elevate a very simple outfit, kind of like this. This girl had a leopard print, Bella Clawba with leopard print shoes. Another really good example. And I love how it elevates this already very chic outfit. White fur coats. This coat makes any outfit a statement. Easily elevates a very casual look. Alpha is definitely speaking to me. I really like how this particular jacket is like more of that longer fur style. Like white, you can also go for a fur coat that is more of like a beige kind of like this. Leather trench coats. Canvas styles have been really popular but are placing that with leather can really dress this with anything. Love going with a really simple fit, kind of like this. Brown is very trendy this year. So even better if the trench coat is brown."," What cool girls will be wearing for summer 2024 for the mid-sized girlies? Vests. I love Vests. I think they have so flattering on a variety of body types. I really like this outfit here paired with denim and then you can even go with like if you wanted to go for something more summery. You could go with like a really cute sandal. Another great example, they're just so easy to style. I love a pair with a good ballet flat. You could also pair it with like a bantee and just keep the vest open for more of like a layered look. You could also leave at half-on-bant and I really am obsessed overall with its style of this vest. I like how squared off it is. Tube top specifically ones that are a little bit more fitted. I think they're so flattering. They show off your curves a little bit. We love showing a little bit of a shoulder for the summer. Really cute paired with like a skirt. Love them also with like a matching set. This is gorgeous. Another skirt example would also look really good with denim. And if you don't like the tube top as much you could also go for like a one shoulder vibe kind of like this. Maxi skirt specifically the really flowy ones. I love this white one with a lot of texture. I just think it's so flattering and fluttering. The great example they pair really well with just like a basic white tee and I love the boots here. If you don't like the flowy ones you could also go with more of like an a-line straight silhouette. I really like the frill at the bottom so it still adds that like flowy effect. I know this specific set is from Drift Avenue and this is just so cute. Dropway stresses again. Essential weighting the natural curves of your body which are gorgeous. Dropway stresses we're getting into your pain summer here. Love how dropway stresses just accentuate and show off your natural curves. I really really like how this girl went a little spunky and out of this hat with this outfit. I'm just personally really obsessed with the style of dress in general. I just think it's so gorgeous effortless. You don't need much to spice it up. The outfit is or the dress is the moment and then you can just add like some cute accessories. Mitty maxi length isn't as much of your thing. You can go for like more of a mini dress or even go for a romper style and then just add some really simple sandals to casual the outfit up a little bit."," Sixth trend to know for 2024 coming out of New York Fashion Week. Our entire editorial team is talking about this right now. Pedal pushers are back and one styled correctly. I really don't mind them. We saw everyone go crazy over the botega drop earrings this year and big chunky earrings are definitely set to continue trending in 2024. Boes and essentially every shape, size and iteration will continue to have a moment. Sheer fabrics aren't going anywhere. We're starting to see them paired with wardrobe basics like blazers and sweaters. We'll see a continuation of the minimalistic dressing we saw through the lens of quiet luxury this year. And we expect to see netted fabrics as well. Even if these trends don't look super wearable, at first glance on the runways, more practical options are already trickling onto the market. You can find more on the trends at the link in our bio."," Let's talk winter 2023 fashion trends. I'm gonna be seeing a lot of bows and ribbons this season. A lot of people are getting creative tying them to bags, putting them in their hair, using accessories, bow earrings, tying them to their shoes. Like this, this, and this. As predicted, first going nowhere this winter, we're gonna be seeing it a lot in coats, as well as trims. Like this, this or this. I'm obsessed with the little trim around the collar and the sleeves, I think that's really unique. We saw it last year too. And yes, red is going nowhere. We're gonna be seeing it a lot this season in tights. Colored tights are in. We're gonna be seeing them like this, this or this. And this is a really cute way to add color. Her outfit is otherwise completely neutral, but adding the pop of pink makes it really cute. This fall, we saw the rise of Mary Jane's and Ballet Flats. And we're bringing them into winter by adding socks. This is another way you can get creative with your accessories this winter by adding a pop of color or a design or a texture. And I think it's a really unique way to play with winter fashion. And let's not forget about our tried and true Sherpa. Sherpa has been a staple for winter for years now, and we're gonna be seeing it a lot again in accessories and jackets. Perhaps the most popular way we're seeing Sherpa this season is in the Tasman Uggboot slippers. They are so cute. I love how she styled it here with the Sherpa and the jacket as well. I would not be surprised if I saw a lot of jackets like this this season too. The red Sherpa, never seen that before, so cute. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more of it this season and be sure to follow for more."," Let's talk about some fall trends I've been seeing recently. I've been seeing a woven large tote bag like this everywhere. I love this red color to incorporate in an outfit, but I also love how it comes in other colors, and really just adds a pop to any outfit. And of course, if you're a neutral girlie, this brown color is so for fall. Next, I've also been seeing biker jackets everywhere, especially one like this that kind of has a distressed look and a two-tone wash, and sticking with that wash that's kind of popular right now, this Mimiu bag is actually to die for. Some fun accessories are these teardrop earrings, belts are huge accessories right now also for the fall, and I'm obsessed with these chunky gold hair clips. If you're going any more formal, I've really been into drop-wave stresses, something like this, and this just screams Sophia Ritchie. Let me know which of these is your favorite trend and what other trends you've been seeing this fall."," Fashion transfer summer 2023. I'm not a fashion major, but I do like to go on Pinterest. So here we go Coming at a very strong number one. We have the straight leg gene or the wide leg gene with appointed toe heel emphasis on the pointed toe heel this combo actually has a toe coat on me if you know you know This is all I wear it's actually kind of bad, but yeah I love my zary gene with a good metallic pointed toe heel I just feel like it takes your office from a five to a good eight Maybe nine like it's just something about the peak of a heel next we have denim on denim like come on now Girls know the girls haven't talked about this. We love a good denim on denim like just fly I'm actually starting to think that denim is my favorite fabric. I had to say it"," Hi guys, are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready to do it. Wait, you're small, really good. Will you get me? I got it. What is it? Do you want me? Do you want me? I prefer few months on the table. Okay, where's it? Kitchen table. We're going to an event at the colony tonight, although it looks like it's about to rain me. I've got really sick. I'm wearing this blazer dress that I got from Zara in New York. I'm obsessed. I was gonna wear it more for work than like events. But yeah, Julia has a gun. It's their new summer scent. I hate it. I know, I have to do the whole thing. That's really good. It's very like summery. Yeah, it's like sunscreen, maybe G almost really good. So blazers Zara, I'll put the code, reference code, if it's available. My shoes are YSL and then I have this little cute straw bag. It feels a little early for straw, but it's April. It's a little late. It's always like summery. I know, it's always like summery. It's always white pants, so he's in the mood wear at all. You want to get it? Yeah, I got my Hugo boss suit. I got it for me. Christmas last year. Really? How much I love? You know how much I love my suits. And fell, going over to the belt is shirts from state and liberty. Awesome place. Really good stretch shirts. They've stretched suits too. That are really good. And then these little loafers here from somewhere on Palm Beach, Toronto. Forget the mouse and Hoffman, I think. Right all over the house. And match was about perfectly. Pretty good box. Okay."," professional but not boring. I just top a lot of these and now I have to go into the office for several meetings. No casual Friday for us today. So I want to do a look where the blazer is the top because we'll work what's driving for now. This is not flattering. Please hold. We might have to start over on the blazer front. I really want to try and find a way to do like the riding boots dipped up in a chic way. I can't decide if it's chic or stupid. All right, it is more lengthening to do tucked in. So we will have to make a fashion statement another day. It doesn't button. That's annoying. I'm really committed to this blazer as a shirt idea that I just came up with this morning and shouldn't be so committed to but so I'm gonna pin it and see if that works. Do it. Underneath the lip hells so you can't see it. Oh my god, I can't believe that actually worked. This is the look, but professional but never boring."," a late summer slash fall transition makeup look. I've been seeing a lot of videos lately about fall trend predictions. One of them being that dark lipstick is going to come back in, so that's what we're going to do today. I've decided that my aesthetic this winter is going to be like 90s which inspired. So think like practical magic charmed Sabrina the Teenage Witch. On skirts, black, kind of like vampy undertones. Just realized I forgot sunscreen so I'm gonna put on my powder sunscreen from color rescience. And it is like glowy look at this. Just like glimmers in the sun. The powder version of looming lotion. Plus, that's good. I'm gonna keep everything monochromatic and stick to burgundy starting with the eyes. Pretty burgundy mascara. Then a really, really deep blush. Right now it's time for the star of the show. The Elf Staining Lip Gloss. This is shade Berry Queen. I believe that this product is only around $6, max $8, and it is my favorite lip gloss color I've ever used. To mention that when it comes off, it stains your lips. So they will literally be this color all day long. Okay, that's the look. Thanks for watching."," There's not that men's 222 Europedition Part 2. Firstly, instead of going for flat caps, go for a more rounded cap instead. Instead of chunky dad sneakers, go for a slimmer and more plain sneaker. This will also help to be able to pair easily with your outfits. And it won't make your outfits as overwhelming. Instead of cargo print, go for a more minimalist print, but also make sure you put some color in there to spice up your outfits."," Hoy навraethogaethau imid am dyslwch y termin oedeg mysfyr.

"," 2024 winter fashion trends, let's get into it. This first trend was incredibly popular last winter and is making a comeback. It's the Micro Mini shorts paired with tights and heels trend. Revolved actually has a bunch of cute and affordable options right now, so I've linked them for you all in my bio. Trauzers are a winter outfit staple and dark denim, specifically black and gray wash jeans are having such a moment. We all know deep cherry red has been a trending color for a while now, and it will absolutely be sticking around through the holidays. However, slate gray and clay blue are gorgeous colors to incorporate into your wardrobe throughout December. In terms of accessories, watches are having such a moment and belts always level up a simplistic look. In terms of textures, suede will still be trending through winter and fur coats are an obvious staple. I hope this video really helped you be sure to hit that follow for more fashion tips and let me know in the comments if you want to part two. Bye."," I'm not talking about micro trends, but here are some cute pieces and outfits that I'm really excited to wear this spring. First up, knit vests. I am loving everything about this. These knit ones are really cute, especially in this heavy gray color. Impaired with the white, fresh, it's light, and it's really sexy with this little peek of skin, but it's not too much. It's not like a crop top, you know? I think a denim vest like this could also be really cute, but what do you guys think? Next, cardigans like this. This looks effortless in the best way. It's oversized, it's slouchy, but again, you still get a peek at the silhouette. So it doesn't feel like bulky or boxy. I love light knits in the spring. It's like a touch of warmth, but not too much. Next, interesting tube tops. We saw this last year, and honestly, I feel like I didn't get enough of it. So we're gonna keep it going this year. This is very much aligning with like the little top-naked bottoms format. Let me just say this is such a flattering shape. I have an outfit just like this, but instead of a dark top, it's with a light top and light bottom. Easily one of my favorite looks last year. So I'm thinking I want a black one now, and maybe some other colors too. Next, backless tops and outfits. I work hard on this back, and I want it out. It's such a little peek-a-boo moment. You take any cute outfit and then make it backless. Now people will look at that outfit and say, oh, she really has taste. Give it to me. Next little two-piece sets like this. Not necessarily in black, but like in a pretty periwinkle blue, maybe even a pale yellow. We know that a matching set is key to making you look put together. So I feel like something like this, or even a pants version like this, with some cute heels, a cute back. It's like a cheat code for a little dinner outfit, a party, whatever. You're gonna look so cute. I can keep going, but I'll end on belts. Especially belts with basic, low effort foundation. Something about a belt with a nice white t-shirt and a cute pair of jeans, off through the 90s supermodel. Immediately. I have unfortunately under utilized belts in the past, but no more. You are going to catch me and looks like this immediately. Lastly, I'll say that with all of these, we will be adding color. Let me know what you're excited to wear this spring."," What cool girls will be wearing for summer 2024? Comfy edition. This cool girl's wanna be comfy too. Blend in pants, there is not a more comfortable pant out there. They're basically pajamas. Even better, a very comfy loose button down with linen pants, comfy sandals. You'll be ready to basically go to sleep. The moment you get home, box or shorts, there is no denying that they are not only really fashionable, but very, very comfy. You really can not go wrong. And there's so many different styles. So if you wanna go very neutral, or you can play around with color, another really, really cute outfit, love the cardi. Rack shorts, very, very comfy and great for a girly on the go. I'm actually really obsessed with the pairing. It'll be like a little fun statement sock and then these loafers. Become in so many cute colors tank tops. These have really made a comeback in the way that there's a lot more like statement pieces being seen. So go for like bold colors, fun patterns. So easy to style and you still feel put together. Oversized tea, right with denim, linen pants, or obsessed with like the sheer skirt combination. So so comfy. It comes to footwear, stick with sneakers. You can even go with ones that are rated to be very, very comfortable, but have a lot of different colorways like the hookas. And if you aren't a sneaker girly, I honestly recommend a good high quality pair of platforms. They are actually really, really comfortable. I feel like they give you a lot more support than one that doesn't have a platform and they just come in so many different styles and they instantly make any outfit cute."," In 2024 color trends, you should know about if you don't already. We are going to be seeing so much of this peach fuzz color. Actually one pantone color of the year 2024. We're mainly going to be seeing peach fuzz in suiting like this or this. I am obsessed with this dress. And as it gets warmer out, we're going to see more of this muted pink, which is very blushy. This is the perfect spring workout fit. We're especially going to be seeing pink and blue together, which brings me to the next color trend, powder blue. Obviously all blues are in for spring and summer. We see navy every year, and that's not going to change. It was just powder blue that dominated runway. We're especially going to be seeing little pops of powder blue, like blue shoes. Love it with a monochromatic look. I haven't stopped thinking about this bubble skirt since the second I saw it. Or this little going outside. And our colors tend to look good with each other. So I like blue and red or blue and yellow together. The main color of spring 2024 is this buttery yellow. I'm not mad about it. This was all over jacomis runway. We're going to see little pops of yellow like this top. These proud of shoes are going to be the next itch shoe. We're going to see a lot of yellow vest suiting. Again, just notice that the yellow is very muted. It's the slightest yellow hue. And I know that all the cool girls are going to be wearing this skirt from Danielle Guizio. I also love how they paired it with the powder blue card again. You guys know we've been seeing a lot of red. That is not going to change. We're just going to see some more summery versions. If you want to shop any of these color trends, I've linked over 30 products in every color category on my shop. As you can see here, make sure you check that out. Bye bye."," All I'm saying is that these outfits are going to stay in trend. Hey guys, it's Javan Sand and I'm going to be doing 20, 23 fashion trends and this addition is Melbourne Winter. So first of course we're going to start with the denim maxi skirts. I reckon this is going to stay in trend for so long because you can keep them warm, put some stockings on them, use those loafers and socks and they're just the most perfect 2000s trend that'll just fit nearly everyone. Then of course I love North Face Jackets. I think we're still going to see these. They're just too warm and you can style them down, you can style them up and they're just perfect for that Melbourne Winter because the wind is just so cold. But we're also going to see them in colors like these ones in the pink and the green ones and they can just go with so many more as well. Then of course you have the acne studio scarf which you can also get it came out for a lot cheaper but I think these are going to stay in and the girly is going to try and make sure that the logo stays at the front so people know it's from acne studios. Like this is what I'll be looking like all of winter. Next is my new personal favorite and I have one coming in the mail is a trench coat style. I think we're going to see lots of these this winter just like red jeans and some comfy shoes as just an extra layer of clothing. But we're also going to see them in hoodies just like this one and I love the hoodie and trench coat look and I reckon it's just going to be perfect. I also have an odd feeling that brown jackets are going to come back in whether that's like leather or like but I also reckon we're going to see blazers that are brown as well. I feel like brown is maybe the new Melbourne Winter look. And of course we can't go wrong with the eggs the eggs are just perfect. I feel like we'll see lots of jeans and like cropped little fur jackets with the eggs but we're also going to see that vanilla girl aesthetic with the thicker eggs as well. Thanks for watching guys and let's see if myDS have super delicious bread and go on an inte"," winter 2023 fashion trends from a fashion major. I'm back. First up we have these buckle boots, like these, these, or these. All I can think of when I see these are the riding boots that we wore in like 2020-12. They also remind me of the super chunky combat boots from the same time, so consider this your warning. 2020-12 fashion is back, but you know what? I love them. This specific pair from you, you is such an attune. Next up is one of my favorites, the exposed brawl, whether it's sewn into the silhouette or you're literally exposing your bra. Like this, this, or this. And going with that, we're seeing a lot of very sculpted cup detailing in tops and dresses, like this, this, this, or this. I'm still seeing a lot of the sweetheart neckline too, like for part two."," I thrifted a second hand collection for myself and created an 18 piece late summer wardrobe. The vibes were comfortable, granola girl, herbal witch with a neutral palette but with some eclectic colorful pieces. I usually thrift one-off pieces but after watching like loads of take talkers who create these cohesive collections, I kind of wanted to try it out. My goal was to make sure every piece was comfortable enough for the August heat but that every outfit was also casual enough to do my daily activities like gardening, walking downtown and melting in my car. Sticking with earthy tones of green and dark brown and pops of red allowed everything to match really well. Let me know what you liked and if there's any outfits you want to see me try on."," Okay, hi guys. We are going to the movies and we're matching like the assholes that like Yeah, we're gonna get matching everything, but we got this PR in the mouth from Shadjav's oven And it's actually sick and we have an unlock from our trip Yeah, I'm wearing a Shadjav's oven sweatshirt the same on the brine's wearing these free city sweats and Rebalk speakers It's your turn. Oh I got my Shadjav's oven. That's it. What do we have? It's your pants or shoes Back up and show"," Out of the day, it's day five of 30 days of winter outfits and I have a little brown in burgundy moment going on but the star of the show is my fur coat that I haven't worn any year. I'm so excited to wear this because it's actually in the 40s today. What the sauce deer from Aegean Teaks, love it. I get to study. And this is my Gucci horse bit. And we'll take the coat off. I'm wearing this oak and forts saji sweater and a size small in this brown color. And then my Zara belts. These are my Joes jeans in the Mia high rise. Tony Bianco brown boots, Zara belts. These are all like my tried and choose. I did just recently get this sweater but like the rest I wear all the time. Have these jeans in a different wash. Mango, mango earrings, Italy and then this is me mew. And that's Alpavte. See you guys soon.", It's day 23 of 30 days of fallout fits and today I want to style some leather pants so let's get right into it These are actually my favorite leather pants and I know that a lot of you guys love them too because so many of you bought them off My like to know it grab this white long sleep light suit this one's from Maritzi And I kind of want to try out my new skims bra This is the bra the straps are like super wide. They sit like all the way out here So you supposed to be able to wear this with like a bunch of different tops or dresses guys You literally can't see the bra at all you wouldn't even know I'm wearing one do these black Zara sock boots Because I love these and I think I want to wear like a healed boot today I haven't been doing healed boots a lot this season. I'm gonna layer on top this great blazer that I got from Zara This is the finished like I added my cat eye sunglasses Gucci bag and this is it. I actually love it There I say this is my new favorite outfit from this series. I think it might be," Short strands for spring and summer 2022 from a fashion major. Last year we definitely saw a lot of much longer, more bermuda-style shorts. I definitely think we're gonna keep seeing those this year. However, I know that they're not everybody's thing. You can definitely still be very on trend with denim shorts without going over the top with something super long or super baggy if that's not your thing. Maybe with something more like this, a little shorter, a little more fitted, something like this, this, or definitely something like this. These are much more fitted and just a little bit longer than regular shorts, but so cute. And like this. Or like these. There we go. We are loving cargo pants right now. So it should come as no surprise that we're gonna be seeing a lot of cargo or carpenter-style shorts. I think we're gonna be seeing this specific pair of ducky shorts everywhere. Like for part 2.", I'm headed out for the day and I'm going to show you my outfit. I'm wearing these boots from Steve Madden. This dress is revolved and this bag is Botega from Revolve. I love the pop of colors.,,,,,,,,
,," For 2025 fashion trends that you need to know about, let's get into it. Micro shorts are the new mini skirt. The great thing is you can wear these all year round. I just love how chic they look. Elevated sportswear is another really big trend this year. It is so chic to pair a Dita's joggers with an oversized for a coat or button down. I cannot get enough of these looks. Okay, next up we have polo tops. They're so fun to layer and accessorize and you can dress them up or down. It's such an effortless, comfy look but still put together. Boho is also going to be in full swing this spring and summer. Think everything free people, lots of patterns, sheer tops, intricate detailing and feminine silhouettes. Last but not least, Zebra is the print of this year. Not your typical black and white Zebra print though. I think we're going to see more of this neutral shade."," Today, we're talking trends. I'm a stylist. I like to be in the know on what websites and articles are posting about fashion. I came across this article from GQ talking about men's autumn and winter trends. They highlight 12 trends. They think we're gonna be seeing this fall and winter season when it comes to men's fashion. I'm gonna go through the 12 trends and say whether I like dislike, agree, disagree. First six in this video, second six in part two. Let's get into it. First up, we have big boss codes. Basically, just meaning long, large, and structured over codes. I absolutely love this trend, especially if you live somewhere cold. I think wearing a large statement over code is an amazing accessory to an outfit. A lot of times, if the code is really cool, you can keep it simple underneath. I'm all about wearing a beautiful code over something like a parka or a puffer. Number two, we have the trend called sheer force. Basically meaning wearing sheer fabrics. I somewhat like the sheer look, but more as a layering piece underneath a jacket. I don't think I would style someone with a full sheer shirt. I also don't think a lot of people would want to wear that anyways. This one seems a little bit over the top to me. The new bucket hat. By new bucket hat, they mean taking that classic bucket hat style and adding in lush textures and out there colors. I think a bucket hat is a really fun accessory to wear, but I definitely think you have to have the personality and the confidence to rock a bucket hat. Because it's definitely more of an out there type of hat, you have to have the certain look in order to rock it. Or the certain outfit. Next up, we have leather weather. I think wearing a leather jacket never goes out of style, but in this article, they were talking about leather pants. A decade or two ago, we were seeing leather pants on people like rock stars, but I guess times are a change in. I think if you should have to a bar in West Hollywood, wearing leather pants and boots, people would think it looked really cool. I think if you should have to a bar in Dallas, wearing leather pants, you might get a few weird looks. What I mean by this is definitely not a trend that will work for everyone. If you enjoy pushing your style outside of its comfort zone and wearing something that's a little bit more out there, then this could be the trend for you. Number five, we have the great camo redux. In my opinion, this trend is actually a little bit outdated to me. I feel like we saw a ton of camo last year, and I feel like it's slowly kind of dying out. I don't think camo looks bad by any means, but I just don't see it being as popular as it was last year. Number six, we have old but new sneakers. I've actually seen this a ton, so instead of last year we saw the trends of the gazelles, the sombers rocking those old vintage sneakers, we're seeing a lot of designers come out with new sneakers, but they have the look of an old sneaker. If that makes sense. You may have teamed up with new bounds, do a collab for five thirties. I think the most popular one being the Dries van Noen sneaker inspired by a seventies running shoe. These are sick. All right guys, that was the first six. They're mainly getting their trend inspiration from what we saw on the runway this year, to give you guys a quick little fashion lesson on how we get to trends. There are two types of theories. One is the trickle up theory. One is the trickle down theory. The trickle down theory is that trends and fashion start with the elites, celebrities, designers, and trickle down to the mass market over time, whereas the trickle up theory originates in lower income groups, subcultures, or street style, and then rise to influence high fashion. In modern fashion, I think that it's a bit of both, especially with social media marketing trends, spreading in both directions. So I'm back for part two to see the second half."," This is the roundup of all the cool girl trends that I'm so excited to see this autumn. Stads are going to be so big this autumn especially start how it's seen on this bag. Not only the stud but this shape in particular I think is just shabby. The yellow can be a really cool piece for the girlies not ready to let go of summer. I'm an autumn lover and can let go of summer but I cannot let go of the bad yellow. Ground breaking I know but yes we're going to see a lot of sweaty jackets. Fort autumn specifically western style. I think it's been bring for a while and we are having a western style. And maybe a little bit buyers because I did just come back from national animes. I still wanted to live out my cargo dreams. If you're not the biggest fan of the western fringe jackets don't worry. I think this is a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous alternative. Look I get it we see this colour every year for full. Can we use to blame? It's gorgeous. The key western styles can be seen in this picture with the jacket and the boots. But the biggest thing I am so excited, the polka dots, polka dots are coming in for full. I know typically polka dots are more summer but the way this is styled for autumn I just think is so beautiful. And if I saw you walking in street and there's I would just be a cool girl. This is the outfit of the girl that I would see out for dreams of the girls and I'm just staring at like, I want to be you. But running back to this photo, boots, the boots are going to be massive. As they are every autumn specifically the 60s 70s style boot. This with the square toad and the colour it's everything. Again the more 70s style boot I think is going to be really big this autumn. This hurts to say as a girl who loves her trainers but I think it's time to put them away. This autumn is all about the boots, the flats, the vintage kit and heels. They're going to be everywhere. And lastly I can see big chunky style belts especially utility kind of sort of belts. Coming in I think they just look so cool. This entire outfit in fact I need to wear it so simple but it is so cool. I'm sorry but if I saw a girl walking around the office looking like this she did me your at least my best friend. I'm sorry but the belt it just it adds it makes the outfit. If you're a cool girl in you already dress like this. No I want your wardrobe and please sell it all unvintered."," But cool girls will be wearing for spring 2024. Part four. Pointed toe sling backs. I love a good pointed toe and I love a sling back. So this is a great combination. Great honestly, if it is a flat and not a heel, so comfortable, so chic, it completely transforms a very casual outfit. Even better if you style with some statement socks. The girlies will still be rocking tote bags which I'm so glad our back. Cool girls like to be functional and there's so many different styles and fabrics she can go with. I personally really love the canvas bags. Statement tights, I love how we're getting into like, successorizing. Statement tights are really easy way to make an outfit so, so fun. Love these blue tights with a denim skirt. I love a good matching matching moment and these red tights are gorgeous. Or if you want to go a little more casual, I really like the combination of the statement tight with the knee high socks. And if tights really aren't a thing, you can always go for a statement sock. Topps with bow accents. In 2023, bows really started popping off around the fall time and they're not going to go anywhere for spring time. They are the perfect subtle statement. This top needs to be in my closet immediately. Not only do we have bows here, but we also have the pinstripe that is coming back this year. It's a really easy way to add some femininity back into your outfit and honestly, just screams like European summer to me."," fashion cool girl edition. Ready to talk about the graphic tees, but something that you're gonna see paired with are these sheer lacy white skirt. I'm starting to see these everywhere and they just scream cool girl. Pared with an oversized sweater and some trainer, love this pop of color with the bag, just keeping it neutral. I'm not gonna lie, I don't think I'm cool enough to pull this off with style and confidence with this. So if you're nervous another way to go about it is a long sleeve like this, this is from free people, paired under a dresser, a dresser is just so cute. The rosette style is not going anywhere, this dress is giving very cool girl spring. But are you talked about the denim on denim and how cool is this set? Or something more subtle like this top? Or fun way to get into this trend is with a hair club, a huge tie around the neck. Definitely gonna see these stripe button ups, but they're gonna be styled very differently than we used to see with the clean girl aesthetic. Or like that quiet luxury style with trousers and a simple bow. While that style is classic, this is cool. Definitely go for oversized, love it paired with the fun pants. Talked about the Tudor print and part one. We're styled with the first few buttons up and the rest open for my personal favorite with a turtleneck underneath. It has to be a really simple light material turtleneck. I also love the different colors outside of just the normal blue. Shoes were still gonna see a lot of the gazelles and sambas, but cool girls weren't unexpected in bright color. Still in the neutral scheme, but this just makes the outfit pop. It can kind of match within the color scheme of the fit, or just be loud and fun. There's so many options, definitely head for second hand or at a posh mark for some cool variety. We've seen these for a while, but these oversized oval colored lenses, you're cool. The blue is a super fun variety for spring, also just these yellow, or with a thicker, tortoise rims. So cool. I keep bringing up denim on denim, but we are gonna see the return of the overall. Really, you should just be keeping a pair in your closet, because cool girls always don't have to pull off overall. So perfect for spring with a trench, or with the oversized button up. Fell for more in coming from Part 3."," Okay, so if you know you know we just had Milan Fashion Week for Fall Winter 2023. I know spring started literally yesterday but we're already on to the next. I'm gonna give you all the trends that you need to look for out of these past shows and all the upcoming styles that you need to add to your closet. Starting with tailored suits. Okay, this is from the Armano Skervino Show. I for sure pronounced that wrong but we're also calling this office core because we are going back to the office this year. We've already seen this in a big way. Blazers been around forever. The pants, the trousers have been around forever but now we are going full tailored slouchy suits. Here's from the Gucci Show, tailored suits, slouchy, we love it. Product red on office core in a really big way this season as well. You can see we don't have the trousers but we have the skirt. We have the whole office core gone on here. Stop getting a little unique with it. We love the cutouts, we love the pleats, the layered effect going on back to the office. Here we go. Okay, one more for Bo-Teg of Inetta because this is perfect. Gorgeous. I'm literally obsessed. Okay, next up we're seeing a lot of faux fur. This next season we're combining it with that whole office core look. I mean look at she's gonna slay but faux fur is coming out in a big way. More faux fur. It's fun, it's frilly, it's gorgeous. This diesel jacket. Gorgeous. Okay, next up are the dimensional flowers. We've been seeing them everywhere. I've been wondering if they're trendy but Milan really said they are here to stay. You also see them paired pre-frequently with the ruffles as you can see here. Gorgeous, beautiful, literally obsessed. Bo-Teg of Inetta also slaying with this, showing us a slightly different way to do the dimensional florals. Rather than to have that one rose that we're seeing all over, obsessed this turquoise color. Also was popping up all over so definitely pay attention to that. Okay, similar vein we're seeing fringe take a big step out this season. I mean anything in 2023 is frilly fun over the top and we are not stopping just because it's fallen winter. Diesel stepping out with the fringe. I love it. This full denim look also giving us a sign that Y2K is not over. We are still very much in it. Okay, of course I ran out of time but come back for part two because there is still so much more to get into you. Starting with these clashing patterns."," and winter 2023 fashion trends from a fashion major. Part two, first up we have red. Red is the it color of the season hands down. We'll be seeing lots of pops of red and accessories like this for this, lots of red bags and lots of red shoes, specifically boots. I think they're so cute. We'll be seeing a lot of red out of wear. The red leather jacket is back. This is all I see, but I love it. And a lot of leather and burgundy are maroon too, like this. Next up is off the shoulders, like this, this or this. And especially for fall, lots of off the shoulder sweaters or sweat addresses like this or like this. We're seeing a lot of leather out of wear with this very worn almost vintage wash like this or like this. This one is a huge trend this season. I still have a lot like for part three."," I'm wearing for the beach today. Beautiful silk dress. By Calita. I'm in love. I will probably just live in it. It is so light, so comfortable, so feminine. My rings, this is Jula. And this is Cartier. This is an X. Like my name. So I'm wearing turquoise and diamonds by Mark Henry. The turquoise is the stone of calm and connection to nature and meditation. The 2023 beach bag. This bag is going to be my summer bag. It is by stowed or stowed, not sure how to pronounce it. But it is so comfortable and so, so entrant. Wonderful giant hat that is protecting me. From the strong Caribbean UV rays. It is an Australian brand called Lack of Color. I mean, not sure why it is Lack of Color, but it is provocative. This is it. Bye!"," Okay, hi guys. This is 30 days of spring outfits. Day four baby. Day four. You're you're getting in on this He's in on it. Okay, so my shorts and my tank are a goldie. I kind of just had to cut this their tanks are so long But I feel like it's working my shoes are Boatega I never wear these that I'm obsessed with them all those my blazer I picked those out My blazer is top shop from Nordstroms and my bag is Myself Shoes for me tonight. I got my Oliver Cabell's on these are a macaque pants These are actually like sort of golfy pants like I got years ago kind of stretchy They're awesome and then shout out to my boy Henry. This is clothing line PB Terry Phenomenal feels like I'm wearing a bath towel. It's a nice Terry cloth. It's a small baby Unbelievable. Okay, so good. All right. Bye guys. Oh, and we're going to dinner. These are dinnerfits"," I'm going off a lunch and I wanted to put together a cute little winter outfit that's like layered and really pretty maybe some boots, a blazer, let's see what I can do. Okay, it's not that cold so I'm gonna start to look with this little white like shirt dress. I'm pretty sure it's from Zafl but we do need to layer that because this obviously looks very summery. I think I'm gonna keep my legs bare and just wear boots so let's add a couple more layers to this. This is already so cute. I could just leave it like this but I think I'm gonna add this A-NM blazer on top just to make it a bit more like structured and wintery. I love this. I love a more like preppy style in winter. I think it looks so chic so let's pick a pair of boots. If I was wearing my black blazer I'd probably would have gone with my black Zara boots but I think the cream lines it just goes with the whole five and these are so nice both of the boots are from Zara and I love this. That is the look I love it so much and I'm not gonna take a handbag because I've got pockets so have a good day."," It's ready with me as a 5-3 size 10-slash 12-girl. This is what I was wearing. Just leggings and oversized graphic tea. It says spooky vibes because I want to wear all these spooky things before the moon ends. I just got this delivered on the mail. These are baggy jeans. So I ordered them one size less. I usually order 31 on our crumbia order this size 30 because I'm a little bit scared of baggy jeans. I don't know why. Who knew they bought them? They're a little bit tied over here. But I didn't want them to look too baggy, too baggy. Let's install them and we'll decide at the end. I have this bodysuit from pre-delittle thing. It's like a rip material. So it has a little bit of texture. Gins are on and haven't taken the tags off because I'm insecure like that. I am not sure about my shoe selection. For my Nike's jewelry, very simple. My necklace. I don't recommend this necklace. It pulls my hair really bad in back. But gold hoops, my Apple watch. So I'm going to wear a flannel. This is a very lightweight flannel. Let me know how I'm going to take the tags off. I need your help. Should I keep these jeans? Sometimes I feel like I like them when I look at myself in the mirror, but sometimes I feel like I don't know. Let's go out."," So my favorite trend of summer is big glasses, the bigger the better. And worst trend is flip flops with your disgusting feet touching the disgusting sidewalk."," Okay, we have another spring blouse. This one's really cute. It's Rouge. It has these little puffer sleeves And then the cuff down here is so cute. I'm wearing an extra small. I probably should have got a small It is pretty cropped so like there's only like one more inch tucked in But I have a super long torso too, so on most people this will probably fit great. I think it's cute with high waisted It's like a cute date night look. I don't know. I think it's like just like a fun romantic Blouse",,,,,,,,
,," are not wearing sneakers this summer. Here's some shoes that are just as comfortable as your sneakers. Or heels of their flats that are comfy. Summer, switch it up, I'm tired. I'm tired of all these sneaker videos. Show me something else. I wanna be like Harry Bradshaw and Sex in the city. Here we go. I am loving mesh flats, mesh sandals. You ever seen in the Simone Bocha? Spring collection, so you know these are gonna be popping. So she's the new. This is my fashion trend. I'm prediction. I don't know why I love the Chinese slipper. I think they're sick. Getting yourself one of these cute little sequins is awesome. I'm obsessed. And they're living like $2. Here's another version. This is dress, van, no tin. I don't actually know designers like this, but... So, if you're sure it doesn't me, but again, the mesh. Spring 2025 collection. If you're on into that and you're still like, I'm a kitten here, love a, find those the most comfy. Boom, I'm going back to the wedge. This one from Bona, Bona Drag Shop. This one's $800 actually, but on Zara. So cute. I love this one, leather. So comfortable, you can wear this everywhere. I guess going along with the mesh theme, I think another one that's going to be popular is the woven style. Absolutely loving them. Anything like this, this, the original is the Botego ones. There's also this dupe on Zara, the woven ballet flots. I just go for burks, at least. Like this, what's this style? Bostang, or like this with the fun color. It's like a bit of a colder day. A loaf of these are so cute for Chanel. These are also super cute, a fun color. I'm doing my first paycheck for my Bico job. This is what it's going to. Mason Marjella, tabius. I love them. This pink is so, the Puma ballet flots. Why are they kind of sick? Also, if you're a sneaker girl. Perfect, the flip flops are coming in this summer. Everybody knows. Like I just don't prepare. They have a cute pair of Zara animal print sandals. These are cute. These, suede high heel sandals from Zara. These are going to become, yeah, you already know. This is how you should be picking out your heels for the summer ones that you can actually wear. Not just to the clerv. These are so like, as well, I think actually everything that's suede is so as well, right? So TikTok, brain rot on me, but a comfortable version of a heel is the clog. These from Zara. These are going to be comfortable. Put it up. Get a clog. You don't want to get a clog. Another comfortable version is something that looks like this shape. These strappy, healed sandals from Zara. So comfy. I can already tell. Actually, going to love like an actual realistic looking ballet. But the strap down the middle, I think is such a cute little touch like a psost. This should have been an apple baby. Another version. I'm obsessed with the Chanel flats. That's all. That's all I got for you guys. Enjoy."," These three winter basics are out and here's what to buy and don't forget to save this for the upcoming winter. This winter 2024, we're seeing lots of basics, turtlenecks, crew neck, sweaters, things like that. But what's outdated is a sweater like this that's called the cashmere light. And then when we're looking at what the material is, recycled polyester, acrylic, and spandex. Instead, if you can try to stick with 100% cashmere, I know that that can be pricey. This is normally $119 and on sale for $39.99 comes in lots of colors. They also have the crew neck version in lots of colors, same price, both 100% cashmere. Second trend, I'm gonna stick with the same theme here. If you are going for just a plain white tank, again, look at that label. So just know what the material is made of. Instead, I've gotten really hooked on this one brand that has organic products. These are 100% organic. And do I always shop this way for my tanks? No, but I will say the ones that I've bought are soft and they hold up so much better in the wash, so that's kind of what hooked me in. Next basic, that was on everybody's list the last couple of years of the big chunky dad sneakers. If you follow me or no, I'm already not a fan. But neutral sneakers are a perfect basic. They will last you forever. I love this pair. And these are always a go-to. You can't go wrong with Nike."," I wish I had you guys my dream wardrobe this winter in my head. As always, Alphan on Pinterest and about fell out like, how freaking cute is this? She's slaying, she's cool, she looks cozy. Actually, who is this girl? Can someone tack her? Right, next up happens to be the same girl, but look at this outfit, y'all. What? I need this vest. Hat, the look, the makeup, I am just living, and I definitely wore this in my dreams. Okay, next up, Alia's face, y'all. First of all, this outfit is so cute. Also, funny story, I saw her out at a restaurant. We sat next to each other and left best friends. No, we didn't talk, but we still left best friends. I mean, do I even need to say anything? Like, let me move so y'all can see this outfit. Like, I can't even, these shoes I need, I need, who is she? Please tag her, because I know she has more fits that I need to see. A green oversized shirt for coat? Yes, please. I don't know if you are these Jean-Jordes over stockings. I have been dying to do that kind of look this winter, but I don't even know how to sew."," What cruel girls will be wearing for summer? Part 6. In 2023, white Maxi skirts started trending, and we're still gonna be seeing those this summer, but we're gonna be seeing a lot more patterns. We're seeing lots of florals. Flat, I think it's another really cute option. I love this whole outfit. Going to need this leopard print skirt immediately. Jorts are still trending this summer. I love this whole ballet flat vest combination. Where they so many different ways, but I love it with a graphic tee, and they pair so well with loafers. I'll never say no to a good denim one, denim look. And if you aren't a fan of Jorts, I recommend going for a pair that has a little bit less volume. Linen sets, I love the vest trouser combination here. You can also go for a set that has shorts or a skirt. Another great example. Great thing about Linen is it is a very breathable fabric, so you can kind of get away with even like a long sleeve button down look like this.

,," Let's do around of things I want to wear slash see this spring 2025. We're back like we never left. First item is a fun and cute little ballet flat. I am obsessed with these from Jeffrey Campbell. They're so fun and adorable and they have a child like quality to them. I also love these silver ones with the little cross in front and one that's more muted but also really beautiful for spring is this all of green color from camper. I also love these cute little suede ones. I found on Pinterest. I don't think that they're real. I think this is like a scam website. So cute and theory but let me know if anyone finds these because I really want them. Next item which is more like an idea is butter yellow. I will say it over and over again until we get sick of me.

It's like the perfect excuse to be lazy with your hair without looking like you. Like this is art and it's just a messy bun. Like if this were just a normal ponytail holder it would be like fine but because it's like a giant silk scrunchie it's art. Also love this little eyelet one for spring.

This is my new obsession. I want them in every color. Last one is more of a concept than an item so bear with me but natural lashes. No mascara. So striking and stunning. I think it is just the most effortless look of all time. This is also just so stunning to me. Like no makeup makeup, no crazy lashes. I got a lash lift a few weeks ago and when I tell you it has changed my life I mean that. I didn't realize how different my lashes were making me look.

Next is metallic yarn specifically in fully fashion knitwear. I love this set. Know how big metallic in general is right now.

But before you start adding everything to cart, let's have a quick chat. I think we can all agree that over consumption has gotten out of control. So before you go out and buy a whole new wardrobe every season, take a look at these trends and decide which pieces are going to go with what you already have in your closet. By adding in a few new pieces, you can keep your wardrobe exciting, but you'll also be able to use what you already have in your closet. All right, let's dive into the trends. Number one, fests are everywhere. I am loving this menswear inspired trend and you're going to be able to find it at most retailers. Number two, wide leg jeans. If it's been a while since you've updated your denim wardrobe, these are an awesome choice. Number three are taller shaft ankle boots. So these are replacing our shorter ankle boots and they go great with the new denim styles. Number four, lady jackets and cardigans. These Chanel inspired pieces usually have some large buttons and they're great layering pieces. And lastly, number five is leopard. Leopard is having a moment again and I for one could not be happier.

Nothing screams that the 2000s are back more than Capri's. You're the love these or hate these, but I do think these are so, so cute. My styles and so many different ways to wear these, but I love this denim look with these little canyelts. They also look really great with a chunky sandal, and I'm obsessed with like this denim pattern that's going on. They look really styled with ballet flats, and then just like casualty, and I'm obsessed with this Cheetah print Capri moment. I never go wrong with a matching set, and I honestly think it makes the Capri moment a little less scary. Mesh flats. Ballet flats start taking over in 2023, and also into 2024, but I do think that the Mesh flat is the it girl for summer. Flats go with so many different things. I love them paired with a maxi dress, and the fact that they're also mesh makes them so practical for summer. Sets with them paired with trouser shorts, and then this shorts lay button down. And then paired with a maxi skirt, like are you kidding me? So cute. Bubble hem mini skirts. They are so, so cute. They mix it up from like a typical skirt, and really feed into that like European summer vibe. Love this combo with the striped cardigan. They make an office so flirty at a little bit of volume. Looks really good. Dress down with a casual t-shirt and some sneakers. If the mini skirt isn't as much of your vibe, I also really love it in a maxi length. Strap was pep-lum tops, another knot to the 2000s. Obsessed with this style and linen. Something a little bit more layered is also super cute. Also pairs really nicely with a shorter, shorter, love this color combo."," This is going to be controversial, but this is what's in and out for Spring 2024, just coming from somebody who's trying to stay in style. It is time to retire the baggy everything because instead, the more fitted approach is now in. I'm kind of heard about this, but sneakers with dresses, not in anymore. Instead, we're seeing loafers and the ballet flat. Barbie movie totally disrupted 2023 fashion, and we saw a lot of Barbie pink in the Barbie core era. But for Spring 2024, we're going to be seeing muted pink and then more of ballet core fashion. And of course, the color of the season is going to be a red, green, and yellow. Our first ones were huge last year. But now instead of the Air Force ones, we're seeing more of a sleeker shoe, and in this case, the Samba. What you'll also notice, a higher socks are going to be more in than the No Show socks. You either hated the low-rise jeans or love the low-rise jeans, but if you hated it, lucky for you, it's going to be out of trend for 2024, and instead, going to be the high-rise jeans. Who remembers the Gucci Ball and the Louis Vuitton purse, where the logos were everywhere. But instead of this, we're moving into a quiet luxury area where the logos aren't going to be as big. Shuncombe is as surprised as the Holy Jeans are now out, and the non-distress are in. That's going to be what trends are we going to miss, what trends do we not agree with?

I still have a lot, like for part three."," Summer trends for 2023. We've talked about these before, but these will be the sneaker of the summer. I'm also going to see a lot of mesh heels and flats. Gingham is back and I'm so excited. We can thanks Sophia, Richie for this, but these types of vests will be everywhere, especially if they're part of a matching set.

I'm also going to see a lot of bags with unique shapes like this and like this.", like me and when you get something new you wear it all the time. We're gonna get along. This is day seven of 30 days of spring outfits and I can't believe I haven't shown you guys these kit pants yet. I am obsessed with them. I feel like I need them in more colors. They're just so great and you've seen casual. I'm going to meet a friend for Lauderdale for lunch today. So this is the fit. Panzer kit top is reformation. My samples are air masks. I always wear these with like a beachy outfit but I kind of like them with this casual fit. My bag is so neat and this is the best everyday bag. My earrings are Johnny Bird and my sunglasses are Amazon., guys let's do get ready with me get ready with me today's an exciting day I'm on my way to winter Anyways these are also gonna miss the train so I wanted to like tie some boots but I'll be freezing it's baltic out so I'm gonna wear these baggy oversized cute jeans jeans from PLT 31 I can't really tell but I'm not taking this off because I've got the foot underneath and I'm not that kind of tramp I'm gonna wear this top from H&M because it's long sleeves and blitches are just put to the other side of the jacket and I'm already sweating like so there we go oh I'm just gonna wear this white hoodie this hoodie is from River Island if you wouldn't direct me off this hoodie because I think it's a take on that I'm essentials but I'm established then I'm gonna wear my boots but I also wanted to like time I have an opponent pony and wear some in back don't have them off so I'm gonna try to get some in the length but not least got a lucky tee e-t-phone it's gonna wear classic black puffer it's gonna wear this crossover bag yeah hair's gonna stay up imagine I've got A-Morph Sun and I'm off have a good day," You guys want to know three more of my favorite two color outfit combinations. This is a good one. You're going to want to save it. I'm going to take you through three two color alpha combinations and show you a ton of inspo. The first two color alpha combination that is always easy to pull off and forever timeless is olive green and black. Now it could tend to look a little bit military, which there's nothing wrong with that, but if you wanted to look more streetwear, you really have to pay attention to the pieces that you're styling. You can never go wrong with an olive green cargo pan. I love how she styled it here with a blazer and a belt. Normally you'd see a cargo pant with sneakers, but I like the way she elevated it with the boot and the bag. And by belting the blazer, it really just takes it up a notch. Showing you how if olive green is a little bit too strong for you, you can add it into your outfit through a bag. Showing you how you could wear it for a nighttime look as well. I love how she paired this Lux olive green silk pant with a slinkier black blouse. And really the bag is the hero piece tying it all together. And you can never go wrong with an olive green maxi coat. This is really a statement coat, but I like that it's also tailored. It feels strong and powerful still. The second two color alpha combination that I love is navy blue and a different blue. I know that you're sticking with in the same color family, but when you mix up the blues, it makes the outfit feel more special and unique. This outfit is so visually pleasing on the eye, just the overstated navy blue jacket, the denim, and the different color blue bag. Love how she paired a brighter blue ox furtage button-down shirt here with a distressed lighter denim, changing up the blue. And then she added a fun bag that expresses her personality that brings the whole outfit home. Love how it's worn here a little bit more effortlessly, casually with a navy blue turtleneck. You can change up the styling with your button-down shirts with things layered underneath like how she has styled it here. Again, when you're a minimal dresser, it's important to pay attention to the styling. It really will just change the whole look. And love this effortless look here and how good and pulled together does this look. Not only did she play with different color blues within the outfit, but she played with texture, a quilted skirt, a mohair sweater. When you're doing monochromatic looks or looks within the same color tone, it's important to pay attention to the fabrics to change up the whole look. It adds personality and interest to any outfit. The third two color alpha combination that I love is brown and beige. Now I know you're thinking that sounds so boring, but look how cool it looks here with elevated brown faux leather trouser and a beautiful silk beige blazer showing you how minimal is not boring. Love this tailored, sophisticated styling with the chocolate brown button-down shirt and a matching beige suit and bringing it all together with the brown crock bag. This is too chic and timeless. She chose to wear beige shoes and do different tones of brown throughout the outfit and notice how she paid attention to the different textures, making it all more visually appealing. It can be a simple and easy and chic as this by just wearing a beige dress and a brown coat. And by matching the bottom of the coat to the bottom of the dress, it pulls the outfit together. Love this casual style and love how she executed the brown and beige here."," Alright, let's do another Aschelian Faction try on this time from SavoSkirt. Alright, it's super hard to find like cute crochet items right now that don't scream festival, but I love this so much. Looks really nice. I can wear it with flats, dress it up if I wanted to. It's like the perfect brunch outfit, but also I love Aschelian brands because they fit petite girls like me. Alright, here's the next outfit. So I'm not a print girl. I appreciate that this is a neutral print so I wanted to try it out. So it's a top and short set. This is nice because you could wear it off the shoulder like this or you could also wear it as just like a regular top. So I don't know what do you guys think. This one I think is really cute and might keep it. Alright, lastly this is very similar to the first dress. However, I love a good matching set and there's just something about the separates that makes me feel comfortable. So I just had to get it to kind of compare, but I don't know they're both so cute. I think I might keep both. What do you guys think?"," has a wardrobe stylist. If I were to rebuild my wardrobe, these are the first pieces that I would invest in. Part two. First is a blazer. Blazers are so versatile, they're timeless, they're classic. Anytime I'm in a pickle of what to wear, I always just grab my blazer with jeans and a t-shirt and some sort of flat or heel and I automatically feel put together. I love this one from Reformation and this one from YSL has been on my wish list for a while. It is so gorgeous. But if you're not a blazer girl, I get it and I would recommend instead of getting some sort of jacket like this one from Bash. It's sophisticated, it's put together, it's elevated and you'll grab for it time and time again when you just want to add another layer or dimension to your outfits. Next is a classic white button down. I have talked about this one before from Sezon. This is the MAC shirt, this is more of an oversized look. I have this in multiple colors and I wear it all the time. You can wear it unbuttoned, you can wear it button tucked in, tucked out, half tucked in, half tucked out, understuff, overstuff. It is the most versatile piece and you will have it forever and wear it often. J Crew makes a super chic one that I absolutely love as well. Next is about about literally ties any outfit together. You can have an outfit that looks completely sloppy, you're talking, you're sure you add about and all the sediments elevated and beautiful. I love this one from Sezon. I've had it for years. It's just a classic and goes with everything. This one from Favorite Daughter as well is also a classic and something that I grab often. Next item is some sort of trouser or like black pants that you can dress up and you dress down. Different from your everyday blue jeans, levied it for something for work. You can even travel in it. These are the effortless pants from Aurezia and I've had them for years in multiple colors and they never fail me. If you are not a trouser girl, I get it. The alternative would be a pant like this, like a gala pant. This is from Lissette super comfortable. You can elevate it with a heel, you can wear it with a flat. This gives a different look than the everyday jeans. Next and finally would be an elevated shoe that you can dress up but is still comfortable and practical. These are a classic from Chanel. Also have these at my wishlist classic style and absolutely beautiful. These are very similar from Veronica Beard, also gorgeous and really just will elevate any outfit that you put on. Let me know what you think in the comments and what you're going to be investing in for your wardrobe soon.",,,,,,,,
,, are trend predictions for 2025. I think we're gonna be seeing a lot of this Isabelle Maramp boho chic vibe so a lot of these relaxed flowing vintage looking looks like this and this. I think we're also gonna be seeing cinched everything like a cinched waist cinched sleeves like this and cinched bottoms like this or like this. I think Sousaouchi ni hai boots are gonna be popular and sweet boots as well. We're definitely gonna be seeing a lot of this stud detailing to kind of give the outfit some edge and to also add some texture. Going along with that I think we're gonna see studs incorporated in different unique ways. We're gonna be seeing a lot of these oversized handheld bags especially faux fur ones. Tonkibing was like this over the sleeves is definitely gonna stay super popular. Statement leather gloves are gonna keep being popular as well. Incorporating like cool colors is a really easy way to elevate all your outfits and it really doesn't take that much thought. Lastly not saying skinny jeans are coming back but we're definitely gonna see more of a switch to a slimmer straight-like jean.," is the 2024 fashion trends are out so I just got some stuff from comments I want to review for you. About like 2024 fashion trends so I can start integrating my styles and moving into the year now. So let's unbag these and see if they fit the 2024 fashion trends. Off the shoulder white top, I'm obsessed with this. Again, we know that off the shoulders huge this year also longer tops are coming back into style. These low waist pants are also coming back into style so I think this kind of low waist change would be really cute. I like being able to play with it more but this is so cute and it's so soft. This is going to be great for going into spring. Okay, don't mind me I have to cover up this because I'm not wearing the right bra for my very bright light on me right now. But sheer and mesh are so in this year I'm obsessed with that. I forgot this tag off but it's so cute. You guys this is a great way to integrate like 2024 fashion trends into your day today. This is jeans phenomenal. You guys you got this to wear as a sweater, dressed like a little shorts underneath. And it is so cute. I'm going to pair this with combat boots that go up to my knee. A little headband or something. This is so cute. Stripes are very in this year. Not a pull like very pinstripes are going to be in. They're going to be a huge trend. So this is why I got this. How cute. I'm obsessed. I'll have everything over here in case you're interested in that. Bye."," fall 2024 fashion trends coming from a fashion student by study's trends. A big thing actually I have in a book full of all the trends that I noticed. A big thing this fall is lady-like chic, so bringing back elegant, sheathness, soft femininity, which is a little bit of structured closing, I guess you can say. So this is a great example of everything that I just said, according again, but it's still still some structured to it and she's wearing a long white skirt. It's super cute, super chic, effortless, his vibes. Okay, here's another good example. It's a high neck and it's a structured dress. Now it is too short because this fall there is actually an emphasis on midi dress dresses, so we'll get to that later, but this is a cute way to kind of like go from summer to fall if you would do a short dress. Okay, if you wanted to kind of be more edgy at this fall, I did see a lot of clothing like this on the right ways, a lot of suit jackets, but like an feminine way, I guess you can say. A lot of them did have longer skirts, like I said, because of the midi fashion coming back, but this is really cute and like rock this, like somebody has to wear this. Okay, I think another great example is this whole outfit. They are emphasizing the puffy skirt. Blue short, it's kind of trim thing, but they're making it into the midi dress skirts, so I think that's really interesting. It's also this whole fall is really focusing on silhouette and emphasizing your silhouette or creating a new one completely with like, broad shoulders or like an emphasized waist, things like that. It's really in this fall. Okay, this is also another perfect like seamless, like elegant chic look that is really prominent this fall. If you wanted to be more edgy, I thought this was really cool. She's technically wearing like a tailored jean jacket and jeans, but it's like a really nice chic, a tailored chic, but it's like the just up this whole thing. Another thing that is prominent this fall is dramatic ruffles, dramatic folds, things like that, dramatic tops, dramatic necklines, so you will see that like very big scoop necks, very big v-necks, a halt attack neck that's maybe like shows a little side boob or something like those are very prominent this fall. I don't know if it was on like everybody's mood board, but to be honest I get like Jackie Kennedy aesthetic vibe from this whole fall. I think she is like the perfect person to look at style-wise if you wanted to kind of like take inspiration from someone. Like I said, high necks, like really just elegant stuff. I didn't really see any with the word like graphics. None of that is either graphics all I think was like really elegant, straight subpoena stuff. Okay so now we're getting into the middies. This is our first mini-mitty dress. So middie is basically past the knee and to the end of your calf or like a little bit above your angle. So I was right before like a maxi dress. And you see these dresses a lot in like the 1920s to the 40s I believe. So or no it's 1930s to 1940s and 50s. Yeah because 1920s had a little flabbergess grids. Yeah so these dresses are going to come back and you might not see them being worn a lot in day-to-day life but also social media. So I'm going to see this look coming back. Now on your day-to-day life you might see something more like this. So this is super cute, super elegant, super chic and you can wear it like you just set up. You know like I've honestly seen people wearing these type of skirts with like graphic tees. Like you could do so much with like this style. If you wanted to take a more business-y approach there's this. I really like this style. It's just good. It's like chic and like she's a boss babe. You know this gives Eurofall. You know what I mean? Like it's a European fall. Super cute. It's very French inspired. I feel like this whole fall 2024. It's very like French and European inspired. So it's really interesting to me. Yeah this is what I was talking about with the graphic tees. I think it's super cute and she's wearing it with sneakers. Like you can wear them with your um what are those shoes called? I forget what they're called. I take on a mini black dress. It's long sleeve. It's midi. It's velvet though. It looks very good on her. Like she is eating a thing up. Like this is gorgeous. Gorgeous. Okay and then here's like a looser like more physical version of a midi dress. Super cute. Super cute. Like not kid-like but useful. Um and it just looks like nice. Like some gives like wedding reception dress. You know what I mean for a bride? Okay I also think that midi is going to show up in pants as well and technically the midi version of pants arc apprises. Now this is kind of crazy but hey I think they're going to come back strong. I know that they try to come back during spring I think and they weren't accepted widely because people don't know how to style them. I think if it's style like this is super cute. Like I think people just need to like experiment. It won't make this super cute. Like I'm obsessed with this and I think they're going to come back strong. Like mark my words. Yes. Me and says that capriets are going to come back fall 2024. Mark my words. And then of course how could I forget animal print? It's going to stay. It's going to stay. It's going to stay for at least a winter to a winter. Um yeah so Cheeto print, leopard print, zebra print, all of the prominent animal prints this fall. Of course they're going to be made into more tops. This looks so cute by the way. She looks so cute. Or even a zebra print dress is going to be a thing I have been seeing them more and more. So you guys have to watch out for them. Go get them. Okay prominent colors this fall are black, whites, creams, browns, mustard yellow, army green, purple and cherry red. So yeah thank you guys for watching. If you made it this far comment a Cheeto emoji and yeah if you guys enjoyed this turn around yeah thank you so much. Bye."," The pink combos that my cool girlies will be wearing this year. Boxer shorts and blazer like this, which essentially is saying I don't care today but I still want to look good. Anyone then either like blue trousers like this or with a maxi skirts like this. Such a versatile combo you can wear it day and night for any occasion really. Green tits shorts. Everyone are from some parts and you can find them in many different colors style as well. I also love those ones with a white band like this one from Sandra or the baggy one like this one from Prada. The cool girlies will know how to make a great contrast like in this case. We have the stripy shorts with the ballerinas that I didn't know I would like them so much until I saw this fit. Like in this case we have the oversized shirts with the loafers and then the trunks with shorts that is just such a strong contrast but the fit itself is really nice. Then we have patterns. They are really discreet like this or as a dress like this. They are such a statement pieces that I think you need to have in your wardrobe because you can wear them either in winter or in summer and they are never gold of time. How simple and effortless is this look but at the same time it's just so beautiful. Particular dress is from power realization but it's currently out of stock so you can rent it easily in birotation. Gorgeous dress from Anthropology. Maxis skirt my favorite one is from Garni but you can also find it in Azos for Amazon. Thank you for listening and follow for more."," This is a PSA, florals for spring are not groundbreaking. So with Abing said, I'm gonna be talking about what spring trends we're gonna be seeing this spring. And honestly, I try to stay true to the classics when it comes to trend, which I know sounds a little contradictory, but I think that some of these looks are timeless and I think that that's the reason why they're trending back in. So let's talk about the accessories and the clothing that you need this spring. Starting off with the chunky hobo bag or chunky shoulder bag. There's just something about it that's just like so effortless and cool. I love how we're kind of doing away with the like teeny purses and the big chunky bags are here to stay. They just are so elegant to me. I love them and how great is it to just like throw things in your bag too and not worry about not being able to fit anything in it. The next trend I think that is here to stay is longer denim shorts. I think we're steering away from like short stuff altogether. Like the longer shorts, the longer skirts, I think that it just gives more of a vintage feel. And honestly, I think it's a lot more flattering for more people to wear a longer length. Like for me personally, I have short legs. So I think longer shorts do more for me. You know? The next trend I think we're gonna see and are already seeing is mixing like bomber jackets with cowboy boots and hats. I think that the hats and the bomber jacket in particularly is just such a vibe. And there's so many ways you can do this with so many different colors. It's just it gives effortlessly cool girl vibe. Pro tip, I would probably thrift those bomber jackets on D-pop or posh mark because you can find some really cool stuff on there and for a pretty good price. The next thing I think we're gonna see a lot and should continue to see is the sweaters around the shoulder vibe. I think that this makes it look very elegant, very chic. You also have an extra layer. If you need it, I can't really put my finger on why, but it just, it makes you look cooler that you have something around your shoulder rather than on. It's like the same thing when you put like your leather jacket or blazer over your shoulders and not wear it. You just look cool. I don't know why. It just, it is what it is. I think we are now in the era of like chunky belts and wearing belts on our waist. I love that belt. I actually think I have one pretty similar to it that I got from Princess Polly. But I'm seeing a lot of cords that's like this with like the longer maxi skirt and people are wearing chunky or belts over it and I love it. Another example of a really cute belt. I'm trying to buy that one. It's from naked fashion, but they're sold out in the size I need. I see another great example. This is a two-fer. Obviously the silk maxi skirt, which I think is amazing and can be worn every season, which we love. And then the chunky belt. Like that's just such a look. I also was just doing it perfectly here with the belt, the jacket, and the long skirt. Like this is such a vibe. I'm obsessed with this look. There's something about the wife-beater maxi skirt and belt combination that it is just hot. And the last thing that I think we're really going to see is the drop-way stresses. Drop-way stresses, drop-way skirts. The bass-way, if you will, we've already seen it come through like the bridal community and the bridal couture world. So I'm a huge fan. I think it's absolutely stunning and really makes you have an hourglass figure. And it's just like, it gives me princess vibes. This is a more casual example. I don't know if it's a skirt or a dress, but she looks amazing. And I know that you'd be like really comfortable and cool even through summer in this. And it's cute as shit.", winter 2023 fashion trends from a fashion major. Part five first up we have shoulder pads like this and or these very rounded dramatic sleeves like this specially cinched at the waist. I'm seeing this a lot in blazer dresses in a similar structured or dramatic silhouette worked into a lot of everyday pieces. Next up we have ballet flats. We've been seeing them for a while and I'm seeing them with a lot more detail this season but they're definitely here to say. Next up is this romantic golfing aesthetic like this or this. If you get in corporees a lot of current trends like sheer lace ruffles still re-like this and a lot of that edgy or accessories we've been seeing. Like for part," some hot shoes for fall 2023 fashion trends from a fashion major. All of these are on the store front of my bio. First trend, tennis shoes like this, and cadidas gazelles, sambas, very sporty aspect to it. So of course, first up we have a Dita's gazelles. Especially love them in this maroon, such a hot color this season. I also love these, or these. These are perfect for this trend. I love them in this color. Big fan of the Adidas campus, or this Adidas superstar for this trend. Seeing a lot of metallics and sneakers, and then shoes over all this season. These are perfect. For these gazelles with the metallic detail, these silver converse. Yes. On to the next trend, it would not be fall without uggs. Still seeing a lot of the ugminis. We're seeing a lot of this color this season. And of course, we have the uggtasments, of them in black for fall and winter. In this shirt prepare, there's already such an issue this season.

Last but not least, we have the Birkenstock Bostons. All of these are from journeys, and will be linked on the storefront in my bio."," are the only three shoes you will need all summer. There's actually these trends are so hot, so take notes. First, we have open toe platforms. Platforms have been all the craze for like the last year or so and the trend is not going anywhere. However, they do have to be open toe, especially for the summer. You don't want your toes getting hot. I wouldn't spend too much money on this trend though, like don't go for designer heels for this because I don't see it lasting like past the end of the year. I would opt for a more budget friendly alternative that's still good quality like shorts or Sam Edelman. I actually have these. They're so comfortable. They're so cute and I got so many compliments when I wore them and also I was literally like six feet tall. Someone who is very petite and five three, I love towering over people, especially men. I'm just like, hi there, little guy. Love the platform moment. The next trend is silver or gold shoes. So basically metallic and brownie points if they're platform two. These aquasura ones are so cute. They're such a vibe. Love. And lastly, we have seen these little roses everywhere. They come on dresses, they come on tops, they even come as necklacees. And now they come as shoes. These are literally a work of art. These are Magda boot rim. They're literally stunning. So perfect for brides. I also have these Saint Laurent ones that I got in Paris two years ago and they are to die for. There you have it. Let me know if you think I miss any hot summer shoot trends. Thanks for watching.

So those are our Tuesday office tips. I guess. Good day."," Hey everyone, styling out for me quick because I gotta go.

And that's my outfit of the day, you go card it, bye!"," I just want to share something I heard today with you guys because when I tell you that literally like sucked all the anxiety out of my body and changed my day So then that causes a lot of anxiety for me is thinking about like what I haven't accomplished yet and what I still want to accomplish and how I'm gonna get bare Boba As important is to keep your eye on the presence also super important to kind of sit in your current accomplishments and acknowledge how far you've come Because guaranteed there's a version of yourself in the past that would be so proud of where you are now Today I was thinking about it and I was like six months ago me I would have been shocked that I was able to even speak to a camera now school and college Me would have been so excited that I made it out of America and I'm getting to live in a cool foreign country It might not have everything you want now, but if you did there would be nothing keeping you going If no one's told you they're probably lately I am and you have to be where you are right now to get to that next spot. So it's okay. I don't know if I like this outfit or not I'm kind of torn. I think with my hair straight I'm more inclined to hitting my outfit, but it's not okay Okay, have an amazing day little princess"," Another Amazon haul coming up. I don't know what it is about this haul but it feels very random. I'll let you guys be the judge. First up, the Crochet, Twitter tank. I didn't know what to make of this but let me tell you. I love this more than I ever would have thought and let me tell you it looks so expensive. Can you say Closet staple? Everyone needs a little black dress in their closet. Immediately yes. The fit of this is perfect. It runs through to size. It comes in a bunch of colors. This would look amazing with just some sombers. It cannot recommend this enough. Okay, I'm just gonna say at this last piece I am so on the fence about. I love blue and white and I thought it was different than anything I'll say in my closet so let's try it on. I'm definitely not hating it. I'm just not sure. Sunnies are all to Amazon. Comment AMA3 to shop.",,,,,,,,,

We love with 3 sets. Sangho is currently giving right now and finds suits available in pasta colors, also in Azos in Market Spencer. Not to mention that the power dressing can make you look way more expensive, no matter the occasion. Being summer 2025 is all about volume, so think of a flowy, parachute kind of shapes with soft and sky inspired colors, fashion that looks like a flowed-out down from the club and nobody style, definitely understood the assignment. We will have navy together with stripes, which we can all agree that cost of style never fall from trends, it's classy and chic. I'm absolutely obsessed with T-shirt from Lily C, or T-Sport of shirt from cost. Whether you wear your trousers or your hot pants or your mini skirt, I'm buttoned your shirt or the fresh twist for your everyday style. Currently I have my eyes on this gorgeous shirt from H&M. Beetle heels are going to have a major comeback. They are going to be your goats who choose for this season. Personally, love them in gold. You must check out this gorgeous pair from Sezenne, Pratizones from Alaya. If you are not athletic, that's fine. You can just pretend from F1 racing to tennis inspired looks. Session will take a sporty turn, but you actually won't need to work out. Very popular right now, we have this pair of trucks from Adidas. Ranges are back in a big way for 2025. Only for the retro jackets or for bags, but also in dresses. Super cute, this dress from other stories right now on discounted price. I found them super fun on summer dresses like this. Thank you for listening and follow for more."," going on a night out and on then this weekend what do you going to wear? Because this is what I'm going to wear. I work full-time in fashion trend forecasting and this is what I'm going to be wearing on my nights out from now on. We want to create that casual chic energy which means mixing detailing like sequins with more casual pieces so inspired by this look from hand over. Even down to the detail of the sparkly socks and the shoes, personally looking for sets like that with this fitted, sequin tall, matching shorts. Just happy into that micro short trend that we're going to be wearing with our tights and big firecoats. There's something about a matching set. You can style it up and down. So effortless and chic with a firecoat and pointed heels. We've got this black set from hand over especially when styled with these boots. As well as with a pair of tights obsessed with silk shirts. You've been here for a while you know that this would be on my trend predictions for this season and we're going to be sliding them for our nights out in London. All of these looks are part of the hand over black Friday sale. I'm going to be getting my hands on definitely a few of these pieces."," Fall 2024 trend predictions for everyday regular girlies. First up, I think that the pop of red is going to shift to a pop of a darker cherry red like seen here. I also think that we are going to be swapping the trendy like tie tops for fall and doing a top button card again situation. We're swapping that out for this. I think trench coats are going to be huge. I think instead of like a puffer coat, it's going to be a trench coat. And also, everyday athlete, your cutesy thing to do. Instead of like boxer shorts as it is right now, it's going to be hoodies. Hoodies layered under your trench coats and blazers. Everyone's going to need neutral hoodies and that's going to be the thing. Get your hoodies ready. I also think that bag charms and like decorating your bags is going to be even bigger. It's already starting to become big, but like I think it's really going to start to surface. Go to part two to see my hair and makeup predictions."," Here's what you should wear if you're visiting New York City this summer. Comfy dresses with sneakers is a New York City favorite. Pick a dress that's easy to throw on, but that expresses your personal style through the shape, the silhouette, the color, the fabric. In 2024, we're moving away from the chunky sneaker into the more slim silhouette, like these here. Most New Yorkers wear sneakers on a day-to-day basis, and colorful ones that add a pop to your outfit are definitely a staple in New Yorkers' closets. I would recommend packing a pair of baggy or wide-leg jeans, something that you can wear with a low profile shoe, like a ballet flat, or the slim silhouette sneakers, like I was talking about. If it's going to be really hot when you visit, like if it's July or August, you could swap the jeans for a pair of wide-leg baggy linen pants, and wear that with the ballet flats and an easy t-shirt and a big slouchy bag. So effort and comfortable is important in New York City, so definitely pack a pair of cut-off denim, something a little bit longer so that you can sit on the subway without your butt hanging out, a cute bell, a tank top, and then a pair of sneakers, like these sambas, and then just pair that with some trendy sunglasses and a pair of hoop earrings, and you're good to go."," We're absolutely doing the spring knit shorts. These are going to be so cute and surprisingly easy to style. I'm obsessed and the statement earring is back. We're going to continue to see vintage and vintage inspired. And I'm here for mixing patterns. This trend is coming back full force. I think we're going to see a lot of this the rest of the year. The leather jackets, especially if they're vintage. These will continue to rise in popularity and it's something that will always be in style. And I think orange accessories and red orange will be the color for spring. Like for the next part."," If you're still wearing these outdated pieces for winter 2023, it's time for an upgrade. Part 2. First, outdated trend. The basic beanie and I say that because that's what it is. It's basic. Instead, what's being shown everywhere right now are the balaclavas like this, like this, and like this. And I'll be honest, the jury's still out on this one for me. Okay, next trend to upgrade. Mesh top, shorts, dresses, all of that. We've been there, done that. Let's move on. Instead for this winter, you want to go with fringe and my mom is going to be obsessed with this one. You could do a jacket like this, fancy your fringe like this, or fringe boots like this. Okay, last trend to update the tiny micro purses. All right, they were everywhere over the last couple of years, but you now want to try oversized tuits like this. Very structured bags like this and baguettes like this. Let me know in the comments if you're going to try any of these trends."," I had to rebuild my wardrobe from scratch. Here's everything I would buy. Number one, a black jean. Do a blue jean. Three is a black trouser. Four is a black miniskirt. Four five is a satin miniskirt. Six, a gray tracksuit. Seven is a black unit hard. Eight is a little black dress. Nine is a black crew neck sweater. Ten, a black coat. Eleven, a trench coat. Twelve, a black blazer. 13, a black sling back. 14, a black knee high boot. 15, a black long sleeve. 17, a black t-shirt. 17, a plain white t-shirt. 18, a neutral sneaker. 19, a black going out top. And 20, a black shoulder bag."," Here are some fashion trends you can wear all summer long. Maxi denim skirts are a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down and are a classy option for any occasion. Another trend that we are seeing a lot are roses. Whether it's a floral print dress or a cute rose tied to your neck as a show per, this piece is perfect for adding a touch of femininity to any outfit. Lays and satin dresses are also very popular this season. They are classy and elegant and can be style in many different ways, which makes them a must have. Remember, it's important to adapt these trends to your personal style. Don't be afraid to mix and match and create your own unique look. And most importantly wear these trends with confidence."," Hi guys, we are doing 30 days of spring elephants. It's day 10. It's day 10. Day 10. And we will just go home from the day. We're wearing very different fits. We usually do this earlier in the day. We do that on the morning. We did it on the morning. But we're ending the day with them. So I'm wearing this with Jean Corset. I love this. It comes with a magic skirt, but I just got the top. And it's great. This skirt is lovers and friends from Revolve. This is a really comfortable one I sized up. So it would be a little bit low waisted. And then my sneakers are Celine. I really like these sneakers. You wear my favorite fits. Yeah, this skirt and the... And I like the skirts that are... I like that they're back in. I think it changed skirts kind of. The denim shorts. They're back ladies. They're hurting her first. Yeah, a lot of them. I'm pretty simple and a little boring. And while walking, advertising for state and liberty. But my suit jacket and pants, state and liberty. And shirts also, state and liberty. Super athletic stretchy. I mean, it's like blue, lemon of work attires. So shoes. And shoes are from Madison Hoffman, overall worth the avenue. And... Bells. It's pretty much it. Bells, I think, basic. I think it's blooming dills. Brand, something simple, basic, easy. Match the shoes. So it's important. All right, bye guys."," There are five of the biggest winter trends that's going to be everywhere in 2022. Ranked from which ones that I like the least to the ones that I like the best. Starting with number five on my list, which are long-temmed skirts and dresses. Maxi skirts and dresses with boots was all the hype this fall. And I'm pretty sure they're gonna follow us throughout whole winter and even up until spring. Next up we have the Western trend, which has been all over the runways, all of our social media, even on the streets. So I think this is a trend that's really here to stay for a while. So we're talking cowboy boots and leather and fringe mostly. Third on my list we have corsets, which is really like a revived trend from last year, I would say. Second on my list we have oversized. So oversized blazers, coats, and jeans are like the main things I would say. I love this trend because it's been here for a while, it's gonna be worth investing in, and I also personally really like the look. But on top of my list I have to say that my favorite trend of season is leather. I just think all pieces in leather look so good from pants, to bags, to shoes, to tops. Leather is just the perfect piece to elevate any outfit."," trends for 2022. It is officially too hot to talk about summer anymore. Statement pendants and medallions are gonna be huge. Genesee wins like this and like this. Love this vintage one. I've been seeing a lot of knacker accessories in general. Like on this scarptop, a lot of us may associate chiffon with warmer months. And I think we're gonna see a lot of it for fall. I love how she styled this one. I also think harnesses are gonna be everywhere. I think it's a really good way to experiment with leather without sweating your balls off. Too bad this one is $15,000."," Another story is so popular in the UK, so we're gonna be checking out if this summer drop will spring summer drop is worth it Now I'm actually very into this shirt. My personal style is like if your grandma was a hoe and so I love floral I would definitely pair this with like an inappropriately small mini skirt But I don't need another one and you should ask yourself if you do too This wasn't too sheer, but this is like the max I would really accept and I'm checking under the collar because sometimes they leave this Exposed and they concealed it which was great I really want to see if this is organic cotton because we know the H&M group and cause definitely knows how to use it When it comes to pricing organic cotton is not that far off from regular cotton Especially in the volumes of which they are purchasing so it's a bit disappointing to see that they didn't use it here This also is supposed to be cotton. It's a CSUQ material So that's why you see this kind of texture and it is gingham as well So it just accentuates that really cute texture I don't find this the most comfortable material ever And I also feel if you're an intermediate so you could definitely try and make a wrap top yourself But overall this was very well done This is about 65 pounds and you can see here They also didn't use organic cotton again That's a bit frustrating because I feel like they use these conscious tags or whatever And it's not consistent across all of their cotton materials These jeans actually kind of go with the first two pieces It's about 75 pounds and this one is organic cotton Now I'm 5 foot one and a lot of people ask if you know it's hard for me to find trousers Because they experience the same issues We can shop like regular sizes It's all about the length of the crotch And actually opting for mid waist Often looks like high waist for us So that's a nice tip I love that they use recycled cotton with the organic Because exactly what we want to see Just wish it was more consistent",,,,,,,,,
,," But cool girls be wearing for spring 2025, part three. One legged pants. This is such a fun style, and I know it's a little trendy, maybe not for everybody, but if you do like something a little bit more edgy, I do think this is something that's really fun to play around with. This style looks really cute in a set. Also, you can go more casual with this polka dots. This is gonna be a really trendy pattern for spring. I've been seeing it absolutely everywhere. Like, cute and sets or dresses, where you could also do something like this with a little pep-lum top. You can never really go wrong with polka dots. White sets. This is a really good mix-up from the bold patterns, including like florals that we see during spring. Something like this light sweater set could be really cool for spring, because I know it can get a little chilly still. Or even more of an ethyl leisure look is really cute. Or something like this is really easy. I feel like we all have a basic tee. And at this point, most of us even have a maxi skirt kind of like this. Ace and Metriple skirts. This is screaming 2000s, but I'm obsessed. I really like this style with more of a dressy edge. Something like this could be also really cute, a really cute like dinner outfit. And I love, of love, the satin fabric. Another great example. A little bit more casual with the basic tee, but still so, so cute."," Let's go through my favorite pieces of 2024. I'm going to start off this list with shoes. I have to include these vagabond boots. These are the head of boots in this gorgeous chocolate brown color. I wore these boots so much. I only purchased these about four months ago and I've worn them literally every single week. The elevate, every single look, they're so insanely comfortable. 10 out of ten would recommend these are incredible. And then of course I had to include these dark mart and Mary Jane chunky platform shoes. Every time I wear these I get so many compliments. I also love that they just wear out so nicely. The more you wear them the better they look. I love in Canada so I had to pick a coat. I decided to go with this beautiful coat from Seiselin. This is the medric coat. It is 100% wool and I love this coat because it is perfect for fall winter and spring. And this color is just so good. She is on the pricey side but I know I will keep this forever and ever so a really good investment piece. I love belts and I don't like thrift all my belts but I did actually buy this made well studded belt. I could be wearing the most basic top of jeans and I put this on and my outfit instantly looks so cool. It is my favorite piece ever. One thing around me is I'm always looking for it be perfect pair jeans and I think I finally found my favorite pair. These are the way high jeans from Everlane and I just love these so much. They're so comfortable. As soon as I got this pair I had to get the darker wash as well and I love these. I also get a lot of compliments on these and they're just very flattering. This is another piece from Seiselin. It is the Emil card again. I actually own a few colors in this specific card again and I love it. It is the perfect chunky knit. I'm obsessed with the buttons. I know I will definitely pick up another color in 2025 just because I wear these two-death. Lastly I had to throw in this scarf. The reason why this scarf is on the list is because it is such high quality. And traditionally I found that a lot of my scarfs end up peeling and just feeling and looking very cheap because they're polyester or I'll find a wool scarf and it will be insanely itchy. But this one from Seiselin is 60% baby alpaca which just means it's so warm and honestly very soft. Honestly as it can eat ingrally I do not think I can live without this. It keeps me so warm and honestly it's just very cute, very chic. That is all my favorite pieces from 2024. Please let me know some of your favorites down below because I'm always looking for good recommendation. I will see you in the next video.", How to look stylish this fall. Today we're styling this cute suede skirt. My outfit is going to be very warm toned. That's why I went for brown tides. Next we're doing this off shoulder sweater. The colors are going pretty well together. I'm not sure if I should tuck the sweater in. Or should I just leave it like this? Finally I can style my favorite boots again. You went crazy on this boot last year. Warm toned outfit means gold jewelry. Never forget the sunnies. I have these two bags and I'm not sure which one is going better with the fit. I think I like that one a little bit more. And this is the final look. I just love these different shades of brown.," There is what the cool girlies will be wearing this spring and summer. Today we are talking belly flats. I love this trend as somebody who loves a comfortable, sensible shoe, MI80. Yes, into these like statement ones right now I'm seeing so many red ones even all over Amazon for like $30. If you just want to dip your toe in, you can always go from where classic pair like our girl, Haley, I really love them with like a skirt or a dress. I just like them make everything look really dainty and cute. Again with the dress, I love this especially a maxi dress. I feel like a lot of the times with maxi as we always see heels. This is just like a different book. It feels really chic. So I'm seeing them pair in a ton with jeans, even jean shorts. I feel like this is a nice change up from like your classic sandal. And if you are wondering, I have my eye on a metallic pair. I feel my favorites that I have picked up this season. If you feel like the belly flat is like too flat for you, this pair is perfect because like it has a baby heel but they're still very like you know simple and cute. I love these. I also picked up these two pairs which are more classic. These are from Primark. They're literally like $10. They're a little more pricey but they have this like really comfy mesh. Aren't they cute? If you want to try the trend, I have a ton of these on my LTK but I love this one."," We are absolutely doing this spring. Ballet, flat, duh. But I'm talking like the real deal. Lace me up, have some fun with it. Carol Jeans. We've talked about these on here a million times. They're gonna work for me every single time. If you think these are unflattering, that's so boring. Peppery, this may be a more palatable link. They can be really chic, you guys. Like this is adorable. Live a little horizontal bags. Just do it. The Sherman Sandals. I have a lot of cute options this year. And they're great if you don't feel like getting a pedicure. And like for the next part."," There are three trends you need to retire in 2023. Croped ankle boots, you guys, they are so dated. I'm not saying ankle boots are out of style. Go for it, but that goes above the ankle. They much more chic and elevated look. Plus style, the most sheer socks if you're wearing pants in the wintertime, by the way. The issue that I have with cropped ankle boots is that it cuts off your leg instead of elongating your leg. So if you wear them with a dress like this, it makes you look shorter than you actually are. You can also opt for an under the knee boot too. They're so cute. Next, crop tops. We're still seeing crop tops on the runway, but we're starting to see more full length tops really take over. This is a great example. Here, you have a higher waistline and it's a full length top tucked in. Or you'll start to see asymmetrical tops with cutouts too. And here's another great example. Lastly, over the knee boots styled like this with skinny jeans and a really fitted moto jacket. I'm not saying over the knee boots are out because they're totally in, but we're styling them different with oversized pieces. And it's more of a matrix gothic aesthetic."," These three trends are out for fall 2023 and here's what to wear instead. Don't forget to save this for when you do your fall shopping. First trend that's out are leggings with long tunics like this one, but leggings they're here to stay. Instead though we're seeing them styled like this, easy to pull off, like this with a vest and boots. These are my all-time favorite leggings in the entire world. I have them in a few different colors and here's another great pair as well. And trend that we're not seeing as much in the fall is the Barbie Core hot pink like this instead. Based on another video I told you red was gonna be the hot color of the season, but another hot color is butter yellow, something like the schroiser, this belt bonus for the studs, these Birkenstocks, and we're even seeing them in sneakers. Last trend that we're really not seeing and this did have a moment for a hot minute, the velour jumpsuit. Instead we're seeing leather sets like this. I love this one from Amazon, something like this, or even just a full-on leather dress like La La is wearing here. Here it is in store."," These are my summer 2023 trend predictions. This is for Australia because obviously our seasons are a little bit different. So my first one and the obvious one is gonna be denim shorts. I personally love denim shorts. I think they're so cool. Just like a loose fit. No chafing this summer guys because these bad boys I got you have. My next trend prediction is the sports jerseys. These are kind of like UK style, Europe style and I feel like they're kind of starting to gain popularity in people's Euro some. So they can obviously be more baggy like the first option or something like this. It's like a tie to fit long line kind of t-shirt vibe which I really like the best. I think that looks so cute. My next thing is of course kind of a spin off from the classic white linen pant. We've got black, like baggy, low rise, not necessarily linen. These ones are from Venom by Know That. I'll be able to sell them as well. I just like the flowy, free, airy sort of pants style for some. Next thing, chunky belts. I've been seeing everyone wearing them in Euro summer again. Glassines has heaps at the moment and they're all that real like white UK boho vibe belts. I love them and so for Dauphin has styled it with like a maxi skirt which I feel like is also something that's just going to be a staple this summer. And my last one is head scoffs. I think we're going to see a lot of influence from the Euro summer style translating or about to Australian summer fashion. I think that so many people have been in Euro summer this year. I also feel like everything that they're wearing in the Euro summer is going to come back and get in popularity here in Australia. And head scoffs are definitely one of them. I feel like they've not really been gaining much traction here in Australia previously. But I love them and I think they look so cute whether you're at the beach inside of a heart or like going to like a beach club, day party. I feel like head scoffs are a vibe."," Hi guys, happy Tuesday. I am going to show a couple properties to a buyer So I wanted to show you guys the fit. It is like a mid-morning mid afternoon And I'm finally getting dressed for the day. They don't have a lot of time So just like clipped my hair up, but I just got this dress from Zara and I love it It's a really nice lightweight knit fabric So super super comfortable my sunglasses. I got these in Greece last fall their door I never wear them, but they're a blue lens in the last week I've been trying to rock them more. My blazer is from Topshop. I Feel like I just need to add another layer make it a little more professional and then my shoes are Louis Vuitton's these were actually my wedding heel. These are the most comfortable shoes I wore these for 12 hours straight at my wedding day and Never had any shoes. I'm pairing those because the dress has weight in it"," If you're struggling with putting together going out outfits during winter season, then you need to watch this video so that you never have to struggle with that again. So the first way would be to play around with different textures. Luckily winter season is all about wearing anything from fur to feathers, to knits and leather, silk, and sparkles. Have fun and dare to mix it up. But don't underestimate a simple outfit, especially with some cool textures going on. Option number 2 is to add a statement piece. Remember that statement pieces are your best friend. So that could be anything from a blazer, a statement coat, or some shoes. A statement piece can also be a bold color, like a shirt, a pair of pants, or even some tights. And lastly, don't forget about matching sets. And you don't need a set that was specifically made to be worn together. It's enough if they have a similar color, tone, pattern, or structure. Do you get anything from your closet that you think could work together? Pick your pieces and don't forget to accessorize."," This, not that, 2022 fashion, I am a bit of a sweater hater, but it really depends on how you style them. Instead of styling it like this, for this, try something like this, this, or this. I also really love this sweater skirt combination. When in doubt, put a button up under it. Shackets are also making their return. Instead of styling it like this, for this, try something like this, this, or this. Even though these pants do have a slimmer leg, the overall look still looks more elevated and more current than the others. Like for the next part."," I'm about to go on a walk and get some coffee. Really into Maxi's skirt this summer. And I found this one on Amazon. It's on my storefront. I've been obsessed with it. Let me show you. We're going to hide myself right now because I'm short, so I'm going to wear it a little way so that I have to wear heels. But it's just a perfect, knit, summer, Maxi's skirt. Thank you for your casuals and some just walking down the street. So I'm just going to wear it with my Zara tank top. I'm going to wear my Steve Madden dad shoes. Bag, I stole from my sister, but I'm pretty sure she got it off of me. So this is it. Let's go get some coffee.",,,,,,,,,
,," Transm actually looking forward to in 2025 as a non-trendy person. After all the minimalism, quite luxury, old money aesthetic, you know what? I am ready for some softness, some prettiness, a beautiful lace top or a boho piece will add so much joy and personality to all those elevated basics. Our glass lasers are here and don't panic, your oversized lasers are not going anywhere. The new cuts are easy going to and there's nothing like those aggressively cinched 2010s versions. With jewelry we're moving away from crisp geometry and more into organic sculptural shapes and you can absolutely layer these with your favorite dainty pieces. I love the contrast. Maxi skirts are taking over from middies and Carolyn Besette Kennedy shows us exactly how to balance that like impossible long lean elegance with something that's more easy going. I'm wearing one that is knit, it's as comfortable as sweats. So it's instant polish when you're too tired to think about what to wear, which I'm sure will happen more than once in 2025. Is this weird? I actually prefer suede in the spring because I don't have to worry about rain and it doesn't feel too heavy for me. I just, I love how it carries color, I love the texture. So what are you looking forward to wearing in the spring? What do you think about these trends? Did I miss any trends?"," One of my goals in 2024 is to get more into fashion. I've always really liked this. I think it is so cute, but I don't think I can pull it off. But mine is well find out. So I got my turtleneck sweater from Lulu's and I got this really cute dress from Lulu's and I feel like this will be cute. Because I would wanna wear this in the winter. I got these like wool lined like tights, they're legit tights, but they're lined and you wear them, you know, underneath the dress to keep warm. Okay, first I put on the turtleneck super cute, super comfy. I also have the tights on and now I'm gonna put the dress. Lulu's fits me. I've never worn anything like this in my life. So a couple things. I like it. I feel like it ages me a lot and I feel like a pilgrim. I'm gonna try to add like a bell. I'm so uncomfortable. I love it, but I hate it. It's so confusing. I love it, but I hate it. I mean, so I would do like a black belt to match the buttons, but I don't have one. So this is what we get for now. And shoes, I feel like black shoes. So hold on a sec. I have never been more confused in my life. Does this look like shit or not? Tell me. Tell me, okay? It's this is not my style at all. Like at fucking all. Like I don't, I look at this and I'm like, fuck no. But I think it is so cute and I am very confused. For me, let me do my hair and my makeup and add a bag and I get an accessory and shit. Okay, bitch, with the hair, the makeup and the bag, I love it. I love it. Like I need to go out. I need to go somewhere. I can get into this. I can absolutely get into it. I'm so far away from it. It's not because I was so uncomfortable with it. And now like I feel really good in this. Need to get boots. I don't own like actual long boots. None of them have a fit my calves. So if you have recommendations, let me know. I am so happy right now. Don't tell me if you hate it because I love it and don't ruin my mood. I feel like I could really like learn how to do this style really well and like just rock that shit, dude. You know what I mean? Oh my god."," trends will see more of this year. Papua is still going strong and I love it. For pre-fall, we're going to see a lot of ankle parties and these shoes are going to be everywhere. We are going to see a lot of boots with shorts and with fall comes the 90s influence. We're still gonna see a lot of chunky bangles and the rumors are true. Skinny jeans may or may not be coming back. We're going to see a lot of demure watches and I've mentioned this before, but it's definitely going to be the year of the brooch and I'm obsessed. Like for the next part."," Let's chat about what the girlies are gonna be wearing this spring and summer. There are so many fun, interesting, kooky little trends popping up, so we're gonna chat through them. The whole thing about trends is like, you do not have to do them. If you don't like them, you don't have to wear them. I think they're fun. They kind of give you something new to try in your wardrobe so you can mix it up. Today, we are talking boxer shorts. As the mayor of Comfy Town, USA, I am obsessed with this trend, because it is so comfortable. Share this last week in so many people, like what do I wear them with? My favorite thing, a little nice t-shirt. Like how this one is a little crop, but you can also go for a longer version. Like this, very cute. Just tuck it in the way you would with regular shorts. Love this as a dressier vibe, this little vest outfit. I thought this was so cute. It feels really chic, really like Paris. I really love it with these little button-up cardigans. I feel like it just looks cozy. It looks like you rolled out of bed, but like intentionally. You can also make it super casual with some dad sneakers, a little crew neck, but I love this. If you wanna try this trend, I got this pair from Amazon. They come in a bunch of colors. Really under 20 bucks, so super affordable. You just wanna give it a try, but I love these. So good."," As a stylist, I'm constantly shopping and looking the runways for inspo, so I thought I'd share some of my trend predictions for this spring. I think tops that are draped up top and with a fitted waistline like this one from L'Oeve, it will be huge. And we'll be paired with more masculine pieces to achieve that tomboy aesthetic we're seeing all over the place. We saw the exaggerated waistlines in Margella's recent iconic Co-Tur show, and I think that'll be translated in stores with more pepilim style tops, but a more updated version like these. Ties and women's wear are gonna be huge, they'll be styled with more casual outfits like these, and worn more so as a scarf. Lairing has been and always will be a thing, but we're seeing a lot of dresses and skirts layered over pants in 2024, just like we saw in the early 2000s. Exaggerated shoulders on the runways are nothing new, but this spring will be seeing them in a more slouchy version like these. It can be bought in stores like these. Let me know some year spring 2024 trend predictions and follow for more fashion content."," winter 2023 fashion trends from a fashion major. I'm back. First up we have these buckle boots, like these, these, or these. All I can think of when I see these are the riding boots that we wore in like 2020-12. They also remind me of the super chunky combat boots from the same time, so consider this your warning. 2020-12 fashion is back, but you know what? I love them. This specific pair from you, you is such an attune. Next up is one of my favorites, the exposed brawl, whether it's sewn into the silhouette or you're literally exposing your bra. Like this, this, or this. And going with that, we're seeing a lot of very sculpted cup detailing in tops and dresses, like this, this, this, or this. I'm still seeing a lot of the sweetheart neckline too, like for part two."," It's officially fall so let's talk about some trends, some staples that you need in your wardrobe, and some of the colors that I think are going to be really popular this fall. So first is the balay slipper. I think this is going to continue to be a huge trend this fall and just an easy pair of shoes for people to throw on that are close to and are super easy to pair with any outfit. I love how she styled the balay slippers here. I feel like she looks so cool and edgy, but the balay slipper is still such a feminine shoe so it's just such a good pairing. X are loafers and I love how she's wearing them here. I also love how they're styled here in a more dressier way. And then I also really love this and it just goes to show that you can wear this with jeans, with a skirt, with a dress literally so versatile and I just love the look of it and it feel like it just is screams fall to me. Okay next is this washed out leather look and I really love this look because I think you can wear it so many different ways. Whether you're wearing cream, gray, brown, black, there are so many different ways that you can wear this jacket and it's just going to be something so easy to throw on during the fall in those colder days. And then here it is again and I really just love how it gives like that vintage look. Okay the next thing that I think it's going to be a huge trend this fall is the cinched blazers. I personally really like this take on the original blazer. I feel like it's just going to give your body shape and be very flattering when paired with really anything. So just to give you guys another idea of how this can actually be very casual. I love how she paired this with just a pair of leggings, a pair of combat boots, her black bag, her hairs and a bun. It's so simple but she looks so put together because of the way the blazer is structured and by pairing you know something more casual with something a little bit more dressed up it's going to just appear like you tried way harder than you probably did. Okay red is going to be such a popular color this year. I already have been seeing it so much and I really love this like cherry deep red. It is again I love how just like chill this woman looks with the pop of red on the boo. I chef's kiss I love this look. Lastly olive green olive green is going to be huge. I feel like it's such a fall color already but those pops of that deep olive green are just going to be everywhere this fall so keep a lookout for that.", There are some cool sneakers for summer if you were tired of seeing some buts everywhere. First are they has their perfect for every day and they have a little bit of a platform. They also have so many colorways. This colorful one is so fun for the summer. Next is Asick Dad sneakers are perfect to pair with any app leisure outfit but they also look really cute with jeans. This Chloe knit sneaker just really screams summer and is really giving off the coastal grandmother aesthetic. And lastly is Alexandra McQueen. The platform sneakers are the perfect everyday shoe that you come in with every outfit this summer.," But when do you guys, I just got this new blouse our dress in the mail and I'm obsessed. So it's crocheted on the top and then it's like a ripped body corn style on the bottom. I honestly thought it was gonna be better quality but I actually love that it's this fabric because it actually stays down when you're walking and it's not too short. I'm pairing it with a Zora Blazer. I love this forever. It's just like an easy oversized style and then my shoes are Steve Madden. I would normally such a hero, but I just tell like something a little more comfortable tonight and then my headband is from Inzen."," Good morning, happy Monday. I'm headed into the office and I want to show you my outfit. So it is pretty cool today. So I'm doing like a black long sleeve ribbon tea and then I'm wearing these black high-waisted jeans that I got from Zara. The top I got from Target and then I'm just pairing it with these flat black boots that I got from Zara like four or five years ago and I'm fine with it like kind of billowing at the bottom. That's the look I was going for. Then I got this new cropped leather jacket from Zara. I'm going to wear it over it. I think I'm just going to wear it kind of like open like this. But this is the outfit for today. Probably going to throw a coat over it because it is like cold. But I only have to go outside once. I'm like, come here. But let me know what you think. I'm the look."," fall 2022 fashion trends from you already know a fashion major. I know it's still summer but we got to prepare. First up we're going to be seeing this style jacket a lot. Like this, a lot with this type of collar, just very straight and angular and a lot more fitted than what we've been seeing lately, I love it. Bonus points for the double zipper. Very similar to that, a lot of coach jackets and bomber jackets. I 100% think this is going to be the it style for jackets this fall. I love that we're seeing a lot of more casual athletic types like this, this or this. I want this one so fun. Some of our favorites are definitely going to be following us into fall like cargo pants, trousers and zikis pants or just work pants. Speaking of pants, yes, we're still going to see a lot of parachute pants. Like this, this or this. I'm out of time like for part two."," Okay guys, so I'm going out with a new friend today for lunch and I'm going to show you guys what I'm wearing. I'm going to wear these Levi's jeans which are the best, the best. I got them from Urban, I've posted them before and I'm thinking of wearing this shirt. This is a vintage impression, I'm sure that I sold them in my mom. I link everything in my LTK so if it's not there just know that it's either really old and I can't find it or it's from in my mom. So let's put this on. These jeans are so good but I will say like if you are getting them size down one or maybe even two. These are a size 23 and I'm not a size 23, I am usually at 25. Like, come on, this is the top. Let me get these shoes. Our forces. For bag, I'm going to do your saddle. These are from Amazon, I am obsessed. They are linked in my Amazon store front.

Plush fabrics will be seen everywhere. Plush jackets and coats will be very popular this winter."," It's finally fall! So today I'm gonna be talking about some fall fashion trends that will make you look like your Pinterest board. The first trend is cardigans. I think this trend is perfect for all, honestly. You need to just take your favorite white shirt, pair of jeans, and just pop on a cardigan and you look literally so put together. You can also pair it with a black mini skirt. The options are limitless. And I feel like everyone just already has a cardigan in their closet. The second trend is red slash burgundy accents. I have been loving this burgundy purse. I've seen it all over Pinterest. The pop of red just like makes the outfit so much less basic and so much more put together looking. I love what this girl did here. She has a little red hair clip, ties in with the red shoes. So cute. You can even do a red leather jacket. Third is like this brown leather vintage jacket kind of vibe. I've also seen this all over Pinterest. And again, I just feel like it's one of those things that you can first of all get from a thrift store for cheap. And then you can just pair of basic outfits just to just look more put together. And you can also pair the black mini skirt in your favorite boots. The next trend I've been loving, I think we've all seen on TikTok, is the leopard print jeans from Paxon. These are actually so cute. And they come in like so many other things. You would literally do pants, a skirt. You could do a jacket. And even a scarf. And I feel like it's just something that makes your outfit look so much less basic and so much more interesting. The next trend is off the shoulders sweaters. Just so cute. I feel like also it's another way to just take something basic and make it more interesting. It's so much more interesting than just wearing a plain old boring sweater. It's also super cute and red and pink."," 2024 Euro Girl Summer outfit ideas, let's get into it. The all-know butter yellow is going to be the color of the summer, the baby pink and a classic blue are also trending. In Europe, you can never go wrong with the business in the front, party and the back mentality. I highly recommend looking for many at maxi dresses, as well as tops that have fun back details. I've said it before, I'll say it again, sneakers are going to be your most worn pair of shoes. Three of the Bolinan pieces are always in style, striped like this, this, and this, along with polka dots are going to be the patterns of choice, opt for shorts like this, or this over distressed denim. And lastly, I know maxi denim skirts were very much in last summer. However, due to the heat, I highly recommend a mini skirt, and due to the wind, I highly recommend a mini skirt. I hope this helped to give you all some fun outfit and info for your European summer vacation, comment down below where you'll be traveling, and hit that follow for more fashion tips. Bye!"," You don't need to follow every single trend. This is my top four trends that I'm not giving in to, just coming from somebody who loves fashion. Everyone's gonna be controversial, but kitten heels. I'm already five, too, and nobody has taken away my height kitten heels, Mickey look like one of grandma, and two, I'm already short enough. Mary Poppins bags are coming, you guys, and I'm just not into it. I don't even carry enough shit to put into that big of a bag. I'm kid, don't even have enough shit to put into my small mini bag. On top of that, I'm already petite, isn't that, if I get a bigger bag on me, now it's gonna make me look freaking even smaller. So that's gonna be it, no. I hate that crop tops are coming out. So, and I really like a good crop top, you guys. Like, is it, am I too old, 30 years old? Guys, I'm not gonna get rid of my crop tops. I know Birkin's Fox 7 in for a while, but now it's not gonna be for me, and don't get me wrong. I have tried them because everybody's raving about how comfortable they are. They are as hard as rocks. When do they ever get comfortable? But other than that, just because things are on trend, or people are making these trend videos, making it included, doesn't mean you need to give them to every trend. Those are just the trends I'm not giving into, so you don't have to either. Let me know if there's other other trends that you hate that you're not giving into, because I wanna know."," It's the time of year again everyone's trend for casting because the seasons are changing but I'm just seeing really weird trend for casting done So I'm gonna give my two cents on what I think is gonna be trending this winter I saw someone predict these boots as trending and I just think it was a very obvious take people are wearing the motorcycle boots all summer But I'm gonna show you what I think is gonna be popular this winter Let me make this clear. I think this is gonna be a micro trend not a macro one the boxing boots slash just boots in this to the wet in general And why is that I think the trend cycles always a pendulum back and forth last year was trending where they're really pointy boots I am talking about these and I think because last year was post-COVID people could travel again people are going outside again And people really want to you know where they're best look their best all the time And I think with that came slightly elevated dressing extra dressing But now there was session hit people aren't going out as much anymore people don't have the money to go out as much anymore People are seeking something practical instead of shoes that you can wear You know just for occasions Which is why I think this will be popular another reason why I think it's gonna be trending is that we're obsessed with appropriating You know sports culture at the moment And I think 2023 was all about reframing from an inity and all that and nostalgia and that's why we were so obsessed with Belay flats during the fall in the summer months I'm only talking about the belay mules or the mumeu belay flats and we're really popular So for me it just makes total sense that a boxing shoe would suddenly become a day-to-day wearing item as is also practical and it looks fashionable But I think it's gonna be a micro trend because the belay core thing was started You know in 2020 and everyone was like belay flats ridiculous never gonna be in style But of course mainstream stores caught to win quite late and production mass production only started this year in belay flats So if we're gonna see anything close to this in the store soon, it's not gonna be this year But a few years down the line But for now people are gonna access them through vintage or yeah archive sales So yeah, that's part one of my trend for casting series before the winter and follow if you want to see more in part two"," I've went through it the day and I just realized I never put my earrings on. Let's fix that. So I'm making a prediction. So each season there is the it color of the season and in the summertime the it color was sage green and I'm predicting for fall 2023 the it color will be brown all different shades of brown. So as a nod to that trend I am wearing these whoop, being the brown. I like pants today style them with these brown kitten heels and then this top which has come with a camel color and I can't tell what color the dots are. I feel like it works really well with these pants. I can't tell if it's black or navy blue or dark gray but either way I feel like you can style it with black navy blue. I also thought this would be a pretty top two word of work if you're going from work to dinner afterwards. Fashion blogger fail. I meant to caveat that it color things so I think brown will be the it color of fall that I meant to caveat and say I think red will also be popular. We're more like pops of red like a red shoe a red bag or red coat or red scarf in the red sweater."," This year's trends which have been your favorite so far. I think I really like like the long skirt with like a boot or I really like the shorts the oversized shorts or like the big statement necklaces. Any least favorites? I don't like the skirts over the jeans. We'll just say that. Alright, and then what are you wearing today? I'm just wearing like a white wife feeder with like this necklace. It's from Gemini Jules. Black skirt and docks. Thank you for your time. Thank you."," Hi guys, happy Friday. I just got back from the event. I didn't have time to film before I left. Because it was at 5. But it was like a sipping shop for Cynthia Rally and Michael, Aaron's new jewelry collection. So this is the fit. Love Shock fancy. Gifting me these pink pants and I'm obsessed with them. They're perfect for this time of year. They're just like really breathable and fun. My top is from Revolve. It is super down. My shoes are why I sell them. They're like the most comfortable platform style. I have my curse sunglasses on and then I left my bag in the car. But I used a little pink jacquemess bag to tie everything together.", back. If you follow me on YouTube you'll know that I took some time off but it's time to get ready for the day. We're heading to Soho Farmhouse this evening for a screening of the holiday and Christmas Carol singing so I want to be warm but I also want to look good. So I'm going to start the outfit off with my Oxblood Amelia Wickstead knitted dress. This colour is absolutely gorgeous. To keep my legs warm I'm wearing a pair of 30 Daniel tights in black. Now I've got two hairbands to choose from and both are from Clementine and Mint. I'm wearing all black accessories but the dress is a gorgeous Oxblood colour. I can't decide. It's a flat boot kind of day and I'm gonna wear these ones from Ferry. I need a bit of a clean though. My outerwear of choice for the day is this stunning ankle length Amelia Wickstead coat. Look at that fabric. My fragrance of choice is Erin Amber Mus. I'm wearing a black cashmisk off from Amazon and some black leather gloves from Fairfax and Favour. Now do you see what I mean about the hairband? It kind of doesn't go when I've got my go-to. My bag of choice is my black amaz but I'm going to probably swap for the black headband and put the red one in my bag for when I take off my coat. I know that's absolutely ridiculous but I'm committed to the colour coordination and that is my outfit ready for Christmas carols at Soho Farmhouse. Let me know what you think in the comments.," in winter 2022 fashion trends from a fashion major part. I don't know, there's a lot. First up, we have cargo skirts like this, this, this, or this. I can't see one without thinking of the mu-mew skirt. A lot of what I'm seeing is the mini cargo skirts like this, but I'm definitely starting to see a lot more of longer cargo skirts like this. Or like this, I wasn't sure how to feel about the mat first, but I actually think they're so cute. Next up, we have lingerie-esque pieces. Pretty much just lots of lace trimming, but specifically ones that look like lingerie. Like this, we've been seeing these for a while, but they're definitely gonna be super trendy for fall. I'm definitely seeing these dresses with a lot of layering, but I'm also seeing them a lot in tops. If this exact one, it's so cute. Honestly, I love this trend as a whole. I still have more, like for part, whatever.", I'm styling lots of girls going on European vacations this summer so I figured I would share with you guys some essential pieces that I think are super versatile to have in your suitcase. First is a white or neutral pair of shorts. I think the tailored look is going to be super popular this summer and it really can go with any top. Plus I always like the lighter colors for summer. Next you're going to need a cute pair of comfy sneakers. You're going to be walking way more than expected in Europe and if you really want to throw on in different pair of shoes you can always pack them in a bag. I think white is a great color option and they can go with your white shorts. I recommend getting some sort of dress to something that you wear at both day and night. I personally recommend getting a neutral color and you can throw on that button up over this and wear it with your sneakers. Let me know if you guys want a pair or two and more style and so.,,,,,,,,,

You're also going to see a ton of tassels on bags Don't choose like for the next part," It's officially cold in New York City so I thought timing was appropriate here for cool girl winter trends. I want to emphasize cool girl so you either dress like this or want to dress like this. Number one is for coats. I know this doesn't come as a first to anyone. We all knew this was coming. I just want to remind you how cool fur coats are and how much you need one. You can wear them with sweatpants, exhibit bean, and sea, or you can dress it up. And they can be long or short. Look at how cool this outfit is. Take it in. It can even better if the coat has a hoodie. Fur is at this winter so try number two is fur hats. And I know we saw these last year but I didn't see enough of them. So I encourage you to participate. It can be a headband of sorts like this or a bucket hat wrapped in fur. Like this or a full Alaska coverage your ear kind of hat like this. And if you have heel boots decorated with fur in some way, you have one winter. These will make you the egg girl. I'm obsessed. Let it be clear. I don't mean this. I don't mean yety boots. Another cool boot option is this. Moving on trend number three is tights. I'm sure some of us have already seen this trend but again, I'm here to remind you of how cool it is. Burgundy is the color of this winter so you won't go wrong with burgundy tights in a black outfit or white. Another example. I don't know what you call them. I call them lace tights. But there are also another good option. You can see them peaking and this. My two favorites are gray tights. So cool. Yes. And yes. And thick brown tights. I love an all brown outfit. Green tights is something. I don't know if I'm ready for it. However blue tights like this. Zendaya gave us to go ahead on blue tights so I think yes. I'm a huge fan of big top a little bottom so this is a way to do it this winter. And my last trend is leg warmers. There's different ways you can wear this. Way number one the most basic is wearing them under your boots. Like this. And this. This. And this. Way number two is over sneakers. Like this. And this. Way number three is over heels. Like this. And this. Gray way to wear your kitten summer heels in the winter. And this. And this. And this. Summer wearing them over uggs. I hate uggs so I won't speak on it. And the fourth way is wearing it as a sock. You don't need a leg warm or you can just wear a cool sock. Like this. And this. And this. Okay but don't do this you'll look like a retired ballerina in a bad way. Do this instead. Okay that is all for my cool girl winter trends. I mean now if you'd like me to share my favorite leg warmers and tights that I use. They're great they're from Amazon and they cost me six dollars. I hope this was helpful and informative."," this, this, or this is your vibe for fall transitional dress. But you don't know how to accomplish it. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. It comes down to just a couple outfit formulas that are actually pretty easy to recreate. First up, big top, big bottom. This counts. So does this. And so does this. Little skirt, big top, this, this, this counts. So does this. And this. You can also accomplish this with a sun dress. Jeans and something with buttons. Jeans and something with buttons. Jeans and something with buttons. Jeans and something with buttons. And lastly, sleek maxi skirt, big top, maxi skirt, big top, sleek maxi skirt, big top, sleek maxi skirt, big top. When you break it down into formulas like this, it gives you a rubric to work with when you're getting dressed. And then it's also easier to mix in match accessories and shoes to iterate on these same formulas. This is the exact same outfit as this. Just styled more casually with sneakers. This is the exact same outfit as this. Just styled a little bit different."," This is the spring summer 2024 Kool-Gall starter pack. First thing on the list are the handover boxer shorts slash pants. Really boxer shorts in general, but particularly this brand is really blowing up right now. Personally I think I'm gonna order these satin ones. I think it's so cool. It's also a matching set so I think I'm gonna order these too. Second thing on the list, even 90s inspired jewelry is really in right now, but I've seen so many people order these. So come in a mixed metal, which I personally love these. I think I might order these as well. If you want to splurge a little bit, Orem has these really cool ones that are very vintage-looking. Next thing are these Salomon sneakers. This is taking like dad shoes slash athletic wear to a whole different level. I've seen so many people rock these. Personally the multi-color ones are a little too much for me. I would go for something a bit more muted like this or more basic, but they're really cool and everyone's wearing them right now. Next is ballet flats. They have just had a huge comeback lately and a lot of the girls are wearing them with socks. Here's Mrs. Cool Girl herself rocking a pair of velvet green ones as well as these see-through studded ones. Kate I think is the inspiration for all of them. Every Campbell has a lot of great dupes for these, so I highly recommend getting them. Lastly, the color brown is still everywhere. I feel like so many people are wearing it. Personally I don't love it, but if I were to wear it, I would probably wear a little mini dress like this. Very hilly beaver style-esque like this outfit is a slay. And it's from Norma Kamali, which is one of my favorite designers. I love all her dresses. They're so easy, so timeless, and they're so reasonably priced, so I would probably go for this one and you can get it on Netaportay. Let me know if you guys are going to be rocking any of these trends. I hope you guys have a good day. Bye."," 2024 spring fashion trend in Zanauts. Let's get into it! Tights in both neutrals and colors are both in as our pleated mini skirts. However, the trend that was super popular last spring, the deconstructed micro mini skirt is out. You're being heavily influenced by the MobWyfare this spring, so shagging for coats are in as our leather micro shorts and belts. Switch out your 90s inspired satin gloves from last spring. Two leather gloves this spring. Leopard print and cherry red are still in. Denim will never go out of style, however the Denim on Denim trend from last spring is not as popular anymore. Instead of Denim, I would opt for leather fur or an edgier texture or print.

Love you guys"," I have decided the fashion aesthetic I want for this summer is like 90s country man vibes. Like those girls in the 90s they got it. It was just basics but like it worked. Don't even get me started on that. That's what I want right there. So I went on Amazon and found everything you need to get that aesthetic so let's go. The collared little polo tops so adorable and even the long sleeved ones like more oversized cropped fit. Very nice. And the B&D NSL tops were very popular especially like plain colored tops for them but then B&D and actual print chef's kiss. They were also very big into holder tops. I'm a big holder top fan so we have to have one of those at home and they also love some crochet and that is super cute. Asset Wash, you done them with fringe. This is a non-negotiable. You have to have this and of course, you've done them cut off. It is the most important part of the wardrobe so we'll be in my gift list and stress and come on. We can not forget about all the bucks."," Hi guys, happy Sunday. What day are we on? It's day 18 of spring outfits. Katta, Mr. Quayton, you missed a little bit. You missed a little bit. We're going to church for Mother's Day and then to brunch. So these are our outfits. You want to start yourself? You want to teach you much on right now? Well, it's simple. I'm wearing this Zimmerman dress. I keep forgetting about the spring. And I can wear these like really bright colors. It's like open and bright. I love this dress. I love the color on you too. The yellow is so beautiful. Thank you. And then these shoes are from Duljabie. And then I got some of the brunch brothers button down. Nice easy throw and go. Pants from a cage. I love these pants obviously. I wear them a lot. And then they're really one of the other ones. I think so. And then these loafers are from Kenneth Cole. Kenneth Cole, I believe. That's a good one. Nice and old for a long time. I love the color though. Kind of neutral. Matches everything. All right. Bye guys. Happy Sunday."," Hello from Hamburg, we're heading to the Christmas markets this evening, so let's get dressed. I'm going to start the outfit off with a cashmere base layer from Intermissomy and a cashmere jumper dress from Amazon. I'm going to be going with these woolen trousers from Ladini. Next up is a pair of 80 Danielle tights from Calzadonia. And I'm going to be going for this green jumper from Moss Bros. My footwear choice today are these brown boots from Crocodton Jones. I'm wearing my most flattering pair of boots from Beary. These are elasticated at the back, so they're super flattering on your legs. A lot quicker to put on than his. Blue vine? Blue vine. We just shout to go around the world. Which is what I'm thinking about. Next up is my navy maxi coat from my previous collection with Caramillon. And I'm going to be going with this green g-lake from Perdi. I really like that it's got a high collar on it because it means that it's going to keep me nice and warm whilst we're out and about. Next up is a cashmere black watch scarf and some cashmere lined leather gloves from NPEEL. And my coat this evening is this navy pea coat from Sandro with the Sheeling collar. It's now the move. A honeycomb. Can you do this up for me please? Next up is my black kelly belt with the gold hardware and my patek leaf watch. I finally have it back. My timepiece today is the dual-tone day just. In my atomizer this evening I have Erin and Brett de Noir. And I'm wearing Ebenefume from Tom Ford. And to complete my look I'm going to be wearing these sway gloves from Moss Bros. And my handbag of choice is my 25th Birkin Madam Celiay in black with the gold hardware. And that is all looks complete to the evening."," The balance has definitely established themselves as an apron for sneakers, so here I feel that I recommend. From a fashion major. First up, we have the 530s. They're the blueprint dad sneaker mowing the lawn barbecue grill vibe, but in the best way. I have this exact pair, I cannot recommend them more. They are my most worn shoe. Next up, we have the 574s. They're one of their most popular, Zelikas, and affordable styles. And it comes in a bunch of different color ways. I have this burgundy pair. I got them for like $40 on sale 10 out of 10. And of course, we all know and love the 550s. I think the 550s like this or this are great for that Air Force 1 alternative vibe. These next few are honestly all pretty similar, but I love them. You got the 993s, the 992s, and the 878s. Last but not least, the 2002 Rs or 2002s, I don't know. I feel like these are the Pinterest shoes."," clothes that I recommend wearing when it's really hot outside. So first off, I highly recommend looking at the fabrics. So I recommend something like this shirt. It's a hundred percent cotton. Or this shirt here, a hundred percent linen. Try to find things that are hot in linen, silk, basically just fabrics that are naturally occurring because when you get into like the polyester, well yes, there's the ray on. They're going to have plastics in them, which are going to cling to the body a lot more, hold the heat in there a lot more. Well, these are going to be really breathable. They're not going to cling to the skin. They're going to be moisture wicking well also, drying much faster than the alternative. So definitely recommend looking at those fabrics. Next, the fit. So you're going to want something that looks there. Like obviously when I'm wearing today, it's really flowy. This shirt, I don't have anything underneath it. So when you go outside, the wind is going to blow between it. It's quite loose still. So it's going to feel like you're basically wearing nothing, which is going to just obviously help keep you a lot more cool. If you have to wear pants, obviously the flowier the better. As I said before, find a material that works well for it. But if you can avoid pants, the shorts are better or a skirt. So just try to make sure that's not tight fitting to your body. Another article of clothing that is such a great choice is dresses. Now, I'm a sucker for a tight fitting dress, but honestly the loose are the dresses better. So I think that's going to flow nicely obviously as previously mentioned. And also the materials, all of that. If you can find something like those, it's going to just help keep you a lot more cool. And it's just going to be a lot better to wear. With shoes, sandals obviously are going to be a much better choice than running shoes or foods. Is there anything like that? Is there open toles? Let's get more flow. And it's not going to be the stick material on your foot. It's going to be nice out in the open. But you can obviously find some shoes that maybe will be closed toles. They'll be a bit more breathable. Just maybe try to stick away from actual running shoes or boots. Tomorrow, I'm going to be filming a part 2 to this video. And that's going to be on how to accessorize once you have that base. So if you have the most basic base, like literally just one basic top or one basic shorts, because you're trying to wear them very least you can, how to accessorize and still make that outfit look really cute. So I'll show you that tomorrow. Bye.",,,,,,,,,
,," everybody's been talking about what they think the biggest fashion trend of 2025 is gonna be. And from what we've seen on the latest runways, it's absolutely gonna be like boho chic vibes. A lot of fringe, a lot of studs, a lot of flowy, loose fitted silhouettes. Now a lot of people are saying that it's giving very much Isabelle Marant vibes, which it is, but I also think it's giving Chloe like this look from Sydney Swainy and also this look from Daisy Heter Jones. This is one of my favorite looks from last year. I love this. I am not really a boho chic type of girl when it comes to my style, but there is a way to take parts and trends that you like without emulating exactly what the trend is if you hear what I'm saying. Like this look from Chloe still has that boho chic vibe. It's closer to my personal style. So if I wanted to take part in this trend, I would find stuff that looks like this if I didn't already have it. So that I would have pieces of my closet that I would wear more than once and that I would invert going later just because it was a trend. We also saw boho chic looks at Sailor-Ront. This is from their Resort 25 collection. I love this. Definitely is nowhere near something I have aware. I'm not a prince kind of girl, but I can appreciate this look. I love this, but something like this, which is also Sailor-Ront, is way more at my speed. So again, if I wanted to participate in this trend, I would buy something that looks like this or this, or this look from Chloe that fits my personal style more. But yeah, how do you feel about the boho rocker chic vibe?"," If you've heard of the recent MobWyfarra trend, Slavic Girl came first, so let's get into the essentials for recreating this look. You shank a hat are an absolute must. Leather or faux fur gloves and dark sunnies are the accessories of choice. Healed knee high boots and chunky moon boots are essential. Faux fur headbands are also super trendy. Lastly and most importantly, a floor length faux fur coat is key. I hope this video really helped you enter your Slavic Girl era. Be sure to hit that follow for more fashion tips and let me know in the comments if you want to part 2. Bye!"," Fall 2024 fashion trends from a fashion style as part seven. If you are a very simple plane dresser, you might want to keep scrolling. Because we are talking mixing animal print, talking mixing polka dots and stripes. A little more subtle, a bombon mixed, different size plaid. Different size plaid sash check at Chanel. The pattern mixing was a little more subtle up deor. The check prints just only being slightly different positioning, and there were some dear alley. More plaid, more stripes. This is at Louis Vuitton. Wrath Lauren mixed different materials to make a patchwork blazer. Denim and Corduroy combos at Stella McCartney. And Atsekai mixed media suits. More patchwork with similar print, different color. I'm shocked about how many people want to talk about Sunglass trends considering it's a lot about just what looks good on your face. But let's get into what I saw in the runway. It was quite the variety. There's super super oversized, a Valentino. Then there were also smaller sunglasses like this. I will say more of this 40 kind that are kind of the same width from the eye all the way to the sides. Also like this. Also nude sunglasses at Stella McCartney, which was also a big trend that I saw streets out photos from Paris Fashion Week. If you've seen my other trend videos, then you may remember me chatting about the dusty rose color that we'll be trending. This translates into sunglasses as well. This pair from Chloe also show us, and she knows they're so beautiful."," If you want to look good this summer, but don't want to wear, I got you. Here are some trends I think all the cool girls are hopping on. One, obviously, shorts. Literally, everyone in their mom is wearing shorts right now. But if you can find graphic shorts, that makes it all the better. And the way she paired it with kitten heels and socks, blah, so cute. Jerisies are also super in. And if you don't like the football ones, because sometimes it can be bit corny, because everyone's doing those, you can also play around with just like a regular mesh top. It's more so like the texture that I think makes it not that look really good. Typhoon tops, I think they're so cute, especially when they're in white. And they've been around since like last year. But I think they're really special if you can play around with the silhouette, kind of like what this does where it's like really baggy. I think playing with celoettes is like the best thing that you can do, the best way to elevate any outfit. It just makes it look more interesting. If you want to be different, and you also want something more breathable, I think something that is more mesh and see through it all is really cute. Every bitch is gonna wear a vest this summer. It's such a universal piece, because you can wear this in the winter in the fall, like with like a button up underneath like this, or you can wear it on its own. And it looks great. And I also let these white stockings, I think it's a great accessory. And speaking of accessories, layer that shit on. Beanie's hats, glasses, bracelets, necklaces, girl, put that shit on, put that shit on. Such a great, great way to make your outfit look so planned. So put together, since you can't really layer on actual like jackets in the summer, I think this is a great way to add extra texture to your outfit. And for the lazy girls like me, this is like summer uniform, just a long maxi dress. I have this one and white in realization power. I wear all the time. I think she made her outfit look more interesting by adding like a hat and like a pop of color in her shoes. And those are my tips. Now y'all better eat with your outfits. I better see all y'all dripped out the summer."," Vote came out with their 2024 spring trends and I'm going to be doing a series where I go through every trend and give you some options if you want to participate First trend that we're seeing is great white dresses This is nothing different than we're seeing for spring and summer But what we're seeing on the runway is a lot of modern white dress styles paired with loafers big belts big accessories So if you want to participate and get a really good white dress for the season here are some of the options Reformation always does dress as well. I love this white dress. It has a beautiful quartz set detail If you want something a bit more simple, but still has some style This is a beautiful strapless white dress from free people for something a bit more flowy. We have this from sabote Frankie's bikinis is known for this dress. This is a beautiful like corseted white dress If you want something a bit flowy, but asymmetrical, there's beautiful dresses at dish House of CB also does really good corset styles and you have options like this white dress This is a beautiful ruffle dress that has some tearing detail here I like this dress from lioness. It has the off the shoulder detail with the droplet waist and ruffle really interesting for a simple Timeless white strapless dress. This one for reformation is beautiful. I also love this dress from Elsa It's really flattering in the front and a stunning open back Those are some of the options for the white dress trend follow me for the rest of the 2024 spring fashion trends"," or jewelry trends that will be huge this winter, let's go. First up pearls. I absolutely love the layered look like this inspo here. And can we talk about this entire outfit? It is perfection. Next up we have mixed metals. Don't even get me started on Spinelli rings. Just look at how beautiful they are. You'll be seeing cuffs everywhere as well. They look so good styled over a blazer like this right here. And over sheer tops like this one. Last but definitely not least, we have statement earrings. My favorite places to shop for them are Heaven Mayhem and Ariom Collective."," Let's talk about Fall 2023 fashion trends, part two. In the last video, talk about the color of the season, other colors that are being incorporated that we might not have seen before and all the different things that we're seeing on the runway. So go check that out if you wanna know more about this. But this is part two. There are some trends that we have to talk about starting with the exaggerated boot. So we are seeing all over the runway everywhere. These very exaggerated boots. Now I put them boots with pointed toes because I'm a pointed toe girl. But a lot of them are also squared toe. So do whatever you want, but just having a very, very big statement boot as the color red is like the color of the season. It seems to be just very, very statement this year, which I feel like fall in the past is usually neutral. It's your everything's happy and cohesive. But now we're doing a lot of statement pieces. So I think that also has to do the 75 that we're seeing and do this in any way that you want. So a lot of people are doing the square toe. Again, I'm a pointed toe girlie, but having this prints, this texture, all these different colors, you can incorporate this so easily, especially if you have things from other seasons that you could just toss in there and throw a neutral coat over and you're good. So the next one that we're seeing is denim on denim on denim in this case. It's really carried over from the summer, which is very, very interesting, but kind of the, they call it the cowboy Texas cowboy suit, something like that, I don't know, but denim on denim, seeing kind of any denim, stock on any denim, there are like set situations. You can really use whatever kind of denim that you have and just stock it. And there's something really beautiful about it, not necessarily being matching, I've noticed. And a lot of people are saying that as well. So again, denim on denim, this is a lot more like chic, it's a lot more business oriented, a lot of denim on denim, but with this, we're also seeing suits being huge again, which is very interesting, like very business casual. I think in style called it like business chic or something like that. A lot of suits, a lot of blazers. So obviously this is the denim version of it, but we know that trend very well. Keep your blazers, we love them, they'll always be great. I'm just such a huge fan of this because it always looks chic. Like this is a very trendy version of it, but you have your blazer, a bit business casual, the turtle neck, and then you can incorporate it into like however you want with your personal style, which is really, really fun. The next one that I absolutely love are these bold statement jackets. I actually showed this picture in the last video because this color is very, very intense. This is a great way of incorporating both of it. This is another great way of incorporating the bold statement jacket with this matching very well. It's very cohesive, but it's bold, it's colorful. It's got the red undertones to it, and you're also incorporating multiple trends at one time. And I also showed this picture in the last one as well. And so this is incorporating the business as well as the cherry red trend. It's very fun, I think it's really cute, and I'm really excited to do it myself. We're seeing a lot of belts of different kinds, skinny belts, big belts, all different kinds, not the super thick ones, but more on the skinny side. I don't know how long this trend will last, but I think it's something very fun that can be used in different ways, and you can always keep it chic so you can use it later on in different seasons as trends come and go. So sorry, running out of time, go to part three for more."," 2023 styles and trends, Pinterest edition, styles that I've had my own that I can't wait to recreate this summer. Started the series on TikTok to hopefully help other women who struggle with fashion and what to wear. Hased on women's clothing boutique and dress women every single day with all different body types to make them feel their most beautiful self. Something into jewelry pearls. So you're gonna see pearls and gold and minimal but statement pieces. Love layering here. You're gonna see lots of layers. I just love this. I think it looks so good. More layers. A lot of tarquoise as well. Pearl gold tarquoise. So good. It's a color. Lots of prints. I love the green pants and the floral tada sheer blouse. I think this is, this would be perfect for like a date night or girls not out. If you don't feel comfortable just wearing something like this by itself, just start like a little blazer over it over your shoulders or put your arms through the sleeves. Love how casual but chic she looks. Throw on a blazer with a white tee, distress shorts and tennis shoes and look how good she looks. I'm obsessed. On repeat. I bought a white blazer this spring off of Amazon to recreate outfits like this. I love this. So much. I think it's the perfect layering piece for this spring and summer. We'll go with everything. It's too hot where you live. Whatever you would put a blazer on over. Put the vest on. So cute. I love the way she looks. I love this outfit. I think she looks so flattering. I think it fits her perfectly. I would do a full body suit versus a bando. But other than that, I think everything is perfection. Living my best coastal grandma vibes with this outfit. Linen blazer with linen shorts and a little knit tank underneath. So good. I felt like the theme of this one is a little bit more casual. So sneakers with tailored shorts and just a strapped long sleeve blouse. You could do a solid. You could do a brunt. You could do a graphic tee. I think she looks so put together. But yet it's so easy. This is a very similar look. Just do a button down and knot it with the shorts. She probably has either a sandal or you can throw a sneaker on with it. Press it up with a colored crossbody bag and some jewelry and you're good to go. We are out of time. I hope that was helpful. Let me know your thoughts. Leave them in the comments. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Hope you'll have a great day.", guys I am going out to dinner tonight. This is 30 days of spring outfits and I wanted to show you the fit. So I just got this little set from Rivalve. I feel like it's really perfect for like a bow day or a beach day but I'm sitting outside and it's really hot. So I figured this would be a great option and then I just paired it with this mage button down. I actually have the matching shorts I love it and I love the colors for summertime. Then I'm wearing these Tony Bianco shoes I love. These because they're so neutral and they're super comfortable. So I wear these a lot this time of year and then I'm using my pink jacquemus bag. People always ask me if anything fits in this and my lipstick and my foam fit and that's pretty much all I need. So this is the final fit. These earrings I just got gifted from the perfect hoop and they're super lightweight and the perfect go-to for summertime.," Okay, so I'm about to go get some lunch and meet a new friend and I want to show you my output for the day. So I am wearing this red knit body suit that I got from Abercrombie. So soft, I'm obsessed with it. And then just wearing this with my distressed one teaspoon jeans that I got from Revolve. And then I'm wearing them with my maroon loafers that I got from Zara. This is the first part of the look. And instead of just calling outside, I am just layering over this oversized wool blazer and then I have my bag. And then I'm just wearing some gold jewelry. Just hop it off. Alien by Nucleur. Love this scent. And this is my look for the day. Let me know what you think. Have a good day."," The newest trend is 90s minimalism. Picture Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Julia Roberts back in the 90s. Their style was everything. The whole aesthetic is about clean lines, neutrals, and versatility. So what pieces do you need to nail this look? A maxi-hem line, whether it's a dresser, a skirt, all the neutral colors like black, white, beige, gray, blues, pretty much anything except for print. tube tops, loose trousers, leather blazers, oversized butt-naps, vests, and satin skirts. What do you think?"," I have been spending a lot of money at this company dish. Have you guys heard of it? And I just bought a bunch of stuff. I'm gonna try it on right now. Whoa, it looks exciting. Sorry, this shit is wrinkly. But look at this. Pretty, right? Buyers cut dress. Little two-tone knit, love it. My style might as well be called out of blazer with everything. Look at this. Oh, this is a look. Feminine with the little dress masculine. Oh, great. Vanilla. You see why they're always taking my money? Oh, it's a four in the jacket and a four in the dress. Sign me up for anything that is summer, menswear, I know these are a wrinkled mask, but can you see the vision? Can you see if this is just envision it smooth and like how shake and sophisticated this is when I'm walking into, I don't know where you're going. Better go somewhere good, by any means. All right, it looks like I'm keeping everything. This is like an asymmetrical long sleeve. Ooh, I just noticed that. That's really chic, little nuance. Great top, right? Everything, love this brand. Was I right?",,,,,,,,,
,," fashion trends that are going to be huge in 2025, part two. Number one, old-school elegans but particularly tweed. We're seeing a lot of tweed jackets, tweed cardigans, tweed dresses, all embellished with beautiful buttons and all different colors, super classic. Number two, over the top accessories. We saw this trend creeping in last year with the bag of charms. This year with accessories more is more. We're seeing lots of chaotic layering with jewelry and lots of stacking. Number three, don't shoot the messenger hot pants. They've been all across the runways. Particularly matching sets like this. Set to become super popular amongst Gen Z from April. Number four is animal print. Last year it was all about the leopard print and while it's still going to be popular this year, we're seeing a whole new wave of animal print. From shoes and accessories, right through to coats and jackets. Number five, thong sandals. Lapt with heels with ankle straps, all going to be super popular in 2025. So go and book him for those pedicures girls."," In the winter of 2024, oversized clothing is going to be still popular. Think big hoodies, jackets, ripped jeans, and beanies for a cool, casual street style, neutral tones, and comfy pieces will be everywhere. Making you look trendy and stylish, chunky knit sweaters are also in. You'll see them paired with high-waisted jeans or skirts, often with layered necklaces, vintage style outerwear like Sherpa Line denim jackets, faux fur coats, and plaid jackets will be making a comeback too, keeping you warm and fashionable. Bright oversized scarves will be a must-have accessory, adding a pop of color to your winter outfits. Oversized puffer jackets are still a go-to for staying warm and looking relaxed and trendy. Wide leg pants and cargo pants are a must-have, especially when styled with crop tops or turtle necks. Platform boots and sneakers are still in, giving your outfit some extra height and edge, and finally, cozy beanies and bucket hats will be everywhere, adding a fun touch to your winter look.", fashion do's and five fashion don'ts if you want to be in style for fall 2024. Don't style your skinny jeans with over the knee boots like this or this. Do style your skinny jeans with the knee high leather boot. Don't style your cropped pants with ankle booties. Do style your cropped pants with loafers like this or this or just with a flat shoe. Don't style your button up shirts by tying them in the front. Do style them just tucked out like this. Don't wear your ankle boots with skinny jeans like this or this. Do style your ankle boots with a pair of jeans that goes over the top of them like this or like this. And lastly don't style your shambra shirts with leggings like this. Do style them with denim on denim like this or like this. Hope this helps.," But cool girls will be wearing for summer, 2024. Cool girls will be staying cool this summer with micro shorts. We saw a little bit of these in 2023. They're here to stay in 2024. I think we're gonna be seeing them actually even more. We'll see them in like a cargo pants style like this one. But I also think we're gonna be seeing micro shorts with more of a feminine edge. Kinda like this one with like the little ruffles at the bottom. Love them paired with a really nice casual look like this one with the tank top and then the bottom up. I think this is so, so cute. We're gonna be seeing a lot of white monochrome. You can mix and match your white and creams. I absolutely love this girly top with this little mini skirt. You also can never go wrong with a basic tee and white shorts. We'll especially be seeing a lot of matching white sets. I am absolutely obsessed with this outfit. It is so chic and elegant. One of my favorite ways to wear white monochrome is linen pants with a button up. Drop waist dresses so flattering, so elegant. Screens European summer to me. So even if you're not going to Europe, you can get the vibes going with a drop waist dress. Especially love it in a midi length. But also love a good mini dress paired with ballet flats. This is so cute. Tracker hats. These have gotten popular over the past few years. They are here to stay in summer 2024. If you like you, either love or hate these, but if you love them or can grow to love them, they're a really great summer accessory. Tracker hats take such a plain, basic summer outfit and really spices them up. It goes perfectly with your typical short tank top sneaker outfit for summer. And it's not only cute, but also practical. Keeps the center of your face."," Hi, who do I think I am with this microphone? I don't know. I just saw a lot of tiktokers using this temperature. I'll try out the audio. You guys let me know if this is any good or not, but I have on my spring fit for day two. I'm going for the cool girl aesthetic somewhere in between Pinterest and reality. Like I want these outfits to be practical. So this is for my fashion grilies who aren't really fashionistas but one dress cute. The ring is set in the first ring. These are going to be so popular either set in four of the fuller skirts that are linen either goes. I don't know. I'm afraid of the oversized linen top because anything big is huge this spring. So big blazers, big oversized tops. There's a that unique look because it's unexpected. I'm going to line up a bit slabgy and over the shoulder to give it more of a relaxed fit. This top in particular is for the linen which is the it fabric for spring. I'm going to put it in the black belly flat because I like to follow this sandwich method which is basically matching your top to your bottom. So in this case I have a black and black belly flat. Another thing that's going to be super popular this spring is mixing neutrals. I have a soft buttery cream top with a white set in skirt. Personally I think it creates a really beautiful look so this is the fit. You know what you guys think."," some hot shoes for fall 2023 fashion trends from a fashion major.

Follows my absolute favorite time of the year and I am so excited. Start off a strong denim on denim. Yes, please. I Love this. I suggest on H&M's website. I are really hitting it hard with all the denim like Structured denim tops over denim pants or jeans. I Love it so much belted it around the small of her waist to accentuate her waist to give her a shape Because if you're not careful and try to do this trend, you're going to look like a box It is not gonna be flattering for the majority of the body tops. Here's another one This is great too. It looks like she may even have her shirt tucked under her bra Potentially or it's a crop. I can't really tell but everything about this is working. She looks adorable White to recreate something like this. There's another one Also, we're seeing a ton of wider legs not quite a flare But like just wide legs all the way down make sure you accentuate your waist Someway somehow whether that be with a belt a tattered fitted top tuck it in like she has Something more flattering and figure friendly seeing a ton of statement Puffy sleeves and get ads just another element to just apply and watch blouse but look how cute she looks Feminine and chic. I just love it paired with pretty much anything another take on the puffy sleeve I really like a statement sleeve underneath a vest I know this is probably all one shirt But it's made to look like a vest over that blouse and I just I like the way this looks You know a lot of oversized things as we have for the last ten years or more It's great. I love an oversized top whatever it is Don't get me wrong. I have plenty of my closet. They're just if you're not careful not very figure flattering Make sure it's not too long You're going to wear something chunky like this and oversized make sure your full body is not covered another way to It's belt the blouse select that button up blouse. She has on under belt that so you're not having two layers of oversized Thanks so when that top layer kind of falls in with your body then you weight your curves your waist a lot of the Chanel Jackets Chanel dupe jackets the tweed I love it classy and elegant and just Such a way to elevate your style just layers obviously layers are just so big and Amazing vest over the white button up with the jeans make sure you're not too boxy You're gonna do an oversized vest like this Preferably I like it with like tights and a boot make sure it's long enough to wear kind of as a dress or Get a long tunic white tunic blouse or whatever color underneath to make it be dress link or where a more form fitted Tapered in vest with your jeans Again, we're just trying to accentuate the smallest part of our bodies We're trying to accentuate our curves and just be flattering and not like your old school Polo Stripped button up tops are Making a comeback and I love it. I wore this style when I was in college. I love that it's coming back I loved it then I love it now. I just think it's so classy the button up with the wide leg pants Hersher crop with a heel. I think adding a heel with anything that's gonna be wide wide leg oversized it just helps give some height to the outfit and just makes it more flattering Cardigans little lightweight sweaters things like this are everywhere this season have been around for quite some time And they're sticking around in a lot of black scar watt blouse the cardigan just elevates the look or a good fall transition It's a good way to wear to not be too hot But had that cardigan to throw on if you do get cold once the sun goes down in the mornings the classroom at work Etcetera, etc. Hope that was helpful.

This is my favorite time of year. I am so excited. Hope you have a great day have a great weekend"," Fashion trends for summer 2023. Let's start with boxer shorts borrowed from the boys. They are going to become a summer staple for everyone. Celebrities such as Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Alexa Chung are already hopping on the effortlessly chic trend. Although it can seem risky since it's basically wearing underwear out in public, you might be soon tossing aside your denim cutouts for this comfy short. Continuing with underwear, we've got lingerie dresses which are going to be trending this summer as well. We're going to see them worn on its own like these or with a blazer and boots which I personally think looks more chic. We've already seen it on celebrities such as Elsa Haasq and Olivia Rodrigo and sheer pieces. We're going to continue seeing sure everywhere this summer but this time in a more feminine way rather than sexy. Next flowers which I'm honestly obsessed as you can see they will continue being very popular going into summer. We're going to see them on dresses, bikinis and even shoes. Let me know in the comments if you would wear any of these and follow me for more fashion tips."," Hi guys, I am going to Nantucket for Memorial Day. I've just been talking, but I wanted to show you guys the outfit I just got in the mail from one mile. These linen cargo pants are so good. They're so comfortable and 5'4"", and I didn't even have to get them under anything. And the waistband, I got a small, they're a little big, but I love that it has this like a little adjustable waistband, so you can make it tighter or looser, however you want them to fit. And then this little sweater is also from one mile. It's just a great like spring, summer, casual, sweater, I love all the detail work and the bell sleeve. So this is today's it."," And we just talked for a second about the outfit over the season. People post outfits of the day, I've done that before, but oh my god, this is the one, this is the one for winter. I literally wear this pretty much every day, I'm gonna show you now. The best thing about it is anyone can do it. So here we go, first of all. Underwear is out, we don't need bras, okay? Well, I certainly don't. The best thing about winter is no one can tell. No one can tell. Let girls fly free. So you start with basically anything you want. Doesn't have to be clean. Could be a vest top, could be a t-shirt, could be this. Anything, then. We layer. Here we go. Actually, anything that's comfy. And for the second layer, you want something that's like, either a jumper or some sort of like a zip-up piece, you think. Could be yours, could be your dad's, could be your boyfriend's, could be your grand, doesn't matter. Because we then get in a big old long coat. Again, could be anyone's. Is it oversized or is it just someone else's? Then I've got to take my hair out for the next bit, okay? So for the next bit, we just put on a hat, could be this sort of thing. Could be. This sort of thing. We'll go with this for now. Next, we're going to grow a scarf. Like that nearly done. Now for the piece to resistance. Right, here we go. Here we go. No one knows I'm wearing pajamas trousers. No one knows I'm not wearing a bra. Am I a pigeon lady or am I walking Paris winter fashion week? Who knows? I don't know if Paris winter fashion week's a thing. Anyway, stay warm, stay comfy. And enjoy no bra season."," It's not quite fall, but I'm ready. Are you ready? I've got all your goods, but say this for later when you're doing all your fall fashion shopping. Fall fashion trends, 22. Okay, first off, popping, specifically jackets. Kim Kay's been doing it, Gigi Hadid's been doing it, a look at her go. I'm talking trench coats, puffer coats, leather jackets, fur jackets, and everything in between. Think Barbie, think 80s. I mean, are we not obsessed with this? Okay, next up, stripes, stripes suits, stripes. Plain colors, neutral colors, fun colors, stripes, dresses. I'm in love with the sweater. Button downs, anything you can imagine. This pinstripe, a laser, and really into it. This is such a classic lip to me. Go along with the stripes. We're going to see a lot of preppy vibes. All our shirts, sweater vest, skirts, headbands, love this layering. We're going to see a lot of the varsity style, v-necks, wetters, on-trusting trims, anything collared. Leather for fall, groundbreaking. But it's going to be everywhere. Leather trench coats, leather dresses, leather bombers, leather on leather, this leather suit. Look at Bella, she looks amazing. I'm talking head to toe, all leather outfits. Okay, that was fun. Fall along for more."," For outfits for a weekend getaway. First up, we have Napa. Here I chose this yellow maxi dress. It's super cute, flowy and breathable. I just added a low heel so you can be comfortable. All will explore in wine country. Nexus Sedona. Here I chose this green biker shorts set along with the sweatshirt in case you get cold into the night, but still keeping you cute and sporty all for the great outdoors. Nexus Cabo. This crochet dress is adjustable at the waist and at the straps, which makes it the perfect beach cover up or a dress to wear to dinner. Lastly, we have Nashville. I went with this crop jacket and this frilly skirt. And of course you can't forget your cowboy boots. I think this is such a cute outfit to crawl around country town.",,,,,,,,,
,," 2025 has started strong interns of fashion, said today in breaking down three key trends for this winter and sharing simple styling tips. Starting off with lace, which is quite expected actually as we've seen this in previous seasons, especially in dresses and skirts. However, this season is all about layering and contrasting textures, meaning pairing sheer fabrics with structured pieces. The go-to colors include black, white, cream and mutes, and then we have soft and different pastels like buttery yellow. For an easy outfit, you can pair a lace skirt or dress with an oversized blazer or even a leather piece to create a different dimension in contrast. Back terms are back. They used to be a thing in the year 2k era and now they're literally everywhere again. You will see everything from oversized and funky pieces up to more minimalistic and leather ones, as it's a way to personalize your own purse and give it character. If you're looking for something chic, you can offer jewelry pieces for bags similar to the back bjou, which is a project introduced in the Paris Art Couture and it's basically an accessory made especially for the birking bags. Animal print is still going strong and this year we have snake print and cow print with fresh takes from Varie Sprunts, whereas leopard remains a staple. To tell you it's more towards a minimalistic aesthetic than opt for something smaller in size, for example shoes, handbags or even hair accessories. So that's it. Lace, back charms and animal print. Let me know in the comments which one you like most."," Here are the items that will be trending for this December. My name is Elle and I do trend forecasting. The first collection is Appraiske Wear. The North Face and Skin's calibration will be really popular, which came out a few days ago, and it's also heavily influenced by the Zara or Ski Collection as well. The next item we'll have is Shirt and Ties in a more unjogener style. We've obviously seen Office Core and Siren Core as an aesthetic, but I think this will definitely come back into more mainstream fashion and be more timeless. The big influence of this is Haley Bieber. Then the final item we have is Fur Coats. More specifically in brown tones. We'll also see these wool sort of fur coats as well, which is a big influence by Charlie X X and Brianna."," How to look chic this form. Today we're wearing this beautiful trench coat. So in the mood for shorts, I have these black ones that I want to wear. I'm doing a simple black base again. I'm also adding this cute thin belt. If you're not into heels then just go for flat boots, sunnies of today. Whenever I wear something oversized I always go for a minimalistic base. This is the final look."," This, not that spring and summer fashion, paper bag shorts. These are so shapeless and they kinda look a bit frumpy. It's time for an upgrade. Instead, go for something more tailored like this, this, or even something like this. You could really dress these up or down and they look a lot more polished, especially when you pair them with a leather belt. The block heel sandal, I feel like we all have a pair of these in our closet. These just feel a bit dated and boring. Instead, try something like this, this, or this. You could also do a comfortable kitten heel like this. I love a good off the shoulder moment, but not that. I would go for something more like this, or this. You could also do an asymmetrical neckline like this. So chic."," Do you actually need this spring trend for your closet? Because I don't know about you, but I'm so sick and tired of buying a sh** for my closet that I know I'm not gonna wear. Barrel jeans. I think this is one of the worst fashion trends to have happened in so long. I definitely think it's gonna be one of those things that we all look back on and we're like, what are we thinking? Like those pictures that we show our kids and they're like, mom, what? I work in fashion so I can appreciate the trend aspect of them and I have seen them styled pretty cool, but I still just don't think they're super flattering. If you do wanna try out this trend, I think this is the best way to do it. Something with just a simple tee on top, definitely a point to toe pump. You're really going to need help elongating your legs, but do I think you need these? Absolutely not. Personally, this is going to be something I'm totally skipping from my closet. Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Do you like these jeans? Are you gonna buy them? Are you passing on them? Do you hate them as much as I do? Let me know. Because remember, you do not need to buy trendy pieces in order to have a stylish, complete wardrobe."," One thing about me is that I will get fixated on one thing and then just like, hyper research it and try to find the perfect thing of that thing, if this makes sense. So right now I am obsessed with finding the perfect black coat. I love staple pieces. I love a capsule wardrobe. I've always wanted a good wool coat. I've tried to thrift it. I am five, two, five, three. It's just really hard. I just don't find very much. So I'm gonna show you guys the four coats that I found. They're like mid price, like 140 to 350, and which I think is pretty good for like a wool coat. So let's get into it. Also, I will link any of these coats that are not sold out. So you guys can shop them if you want. I'm not keeping all of them. I'm really just trying to find one. This one's from Mango. It is a single-breasted structured coat. I'm pregnant, by the way. I'm like 21 weeks, so I'm trying to cover that up so you can like get an idea for those of you not pregnant people. This is it. I think the length is really good. Actually, it's not like borderline too long, but I think I can get away with not himming it with a little bit of height. It's with these little sling backs. There we go. That's what this looks like. I think it's really cute. I don't think I would ever button it. I don't love that it flares out at the bottom and it is a bit tight. This is next to small. I think I might size up in it, so I might exchange it just to try on the small. But I think the quality is amazing. It's Italian wool. It's fully lined all the way down, which I really like. Buckets are right here. I can pretend I have my hands in the buckets. What it looks like. How it would look if I did like a flat. So that is my first mango coat. I ordered a second one. Okay, this is the second one. It is only lined halfway down. It's a much thinner material, almost like a wool felt coat. So not quite as thick. It is double-breasted. Still don't think I would ever close it all the way. But this is how this one looks. I just like can't decide, which fit I like better. It's much slouchier. I'm gonna show you with a little bit of height. How it looks. This is it with a flat. And here's the back. This is the one from costs. It is fully lined all the way down. Shoulder pads are way too big for me, I think. I think I'm just too petite for this coat. It just looks like the arms are stubby and it's really wide and boxy. Maybe I'm wrong though. Maybe it's a vibe and I don't know what I'm talking about, but I feel like at first glance, I think this looks kind of silly on me. Like I'm just playing dress up. Obviously, it's sling backs to kind of give you an idea. Look at some height. The flat. Can I got my hands on the pockets? And this is, it looks. Okay, you guys might think I'm crazy, but I feel like this one's my favorite one. It is way too long. By the way, this one's from H&M. It is sold out. It was the cheapest one. It was only like 140. I think you can sign up for restock notifications though, but this is the extra small. It is so long, I would definitely get it tailored. I just still can't decide if it's like too big up top though. Like if hemming it would solve how big it is, or if I need to get it tailored a little bit to like take some of the bulk away, which I would be happy to do, because it was so cheap. And I really like it. This one's not made out of wool. It's actually the last day in Impoliester, but I don't mind because it looks so good. It's thick, it's fully lined. It has plenty of room for sweaters, and this is how it looks with like a flat. Here it is with a little bit of height. I think it's pretty chic. I don't know you guys, my friend thinks I'm crazy and thinks like I, it's just way too big, which it is. Okay, I know it is, but I feel like that's the point. I also did a deep dive on some sweaters, Granada Day on Pregnant. I would normally be going for cardigans. I like wearing cardigans buttoned up. So with a bump, it's not that cute. So I did a little sweater haul too. So follow for part two for the sweater haul."," Let's talk about fashion trends for 2023 part two. I think it goes without saying chunky nits are always a guess. I specifically have been loving these like, tri color ones. I feel like it just makes you stand out a little more, look them a little more fashionable than just like a solid color. Or if you do like your solid colors or neutrals, you can always opt for something like this. It looks like there's a little tie. It just kind of makes it look a little less casual, if you will. Here's another example. Like if she just had a white sweater on, yes, it would be cute, but this makes it so much better. And as you can see, she's wearing the odds. So they'd be full without ugs. No. I actually just got my hands on these, they're the new color, and I love them. They also have this beautiful yellow, and I was this close to getting them, but I was like, I have to be practical. I just feel like the ugs are here to stay for at least a few more years. We know they disappeared for a while, but they're just so cute, so comfortable. Here's a picture of me styling ugs last fall. These ughtod slippers were so popular, and I'm sure they will be again this year. Kicking off of the chunky nits, we also have our sludgey sweater. They look like these were big a few years ago, but in a more casual way, elevated it with a pleated skirt, a little button up. She looks very effortless, but in the best way, kind of like how until the durf styles herself, great capsule pieces to having a wardrobe. Stavin jewelry like this is going to be humongous. She has on just a simple outfit, and she added a bajillion accessories that just made her style elevate so many levels. Things like this are so easy to thrift. I have three sets of pearls that I found at the thrift store for under $3 each. Another simple full accessory now that we're on accessories is ties. I talked briefly about this in part one as I did last year as well, they are here to stay. Another thing you can find at the thrift store or your dad or boyfriend's closet. Lingbacks are making such a comeback this season. I feel like in the spring, they were kind of tipped-towing the way in, but didn't really get there, but they're here. This is such a classic elegant style, and if you're more of a trendy girl, you can always opt for something like this. These are gorgeous. I love the buckles on them. It's giving Carrie Bradshaw. I don't like random but pep-blem-topped. I don't hate it. He's were huge when I was in high school like the Hollister Abercrombie ones with the little puff sleeves, but this, I can bring that. To me, they just scream femininity, and I just love that. This is beautiful. With some trousers like the last girl had to, oh, more some more structured ones like this. We all know that beautiful white midi skirt was the it girl item of the summer, and we are not letting go of it for fall guys. Love the way she styled it with the little loafers and the oversized jacket and sweater. She looks so cool. I feel like the recipe to a Pinterest outfit is literally wearing something girly mixed with something masculine, and you are just the style point. I really feel like we've cracked the code. Another thing that has been absolutely terrorizing my Pinterest is jackets like this. They'd be called like a patchwork bomber jacket. This is a great full transition piece that can also be brought into the spring. I need to get my hands on this. Obviously chunky scarves goes without saying. That's where I feel like the big plaid ones were such a try. This year I feel like we should keep it a little more simple and do these solid bold primary colors. Like I said in the first video, red is going to be the it color of the season. I feel like a red scarf will just pop every single outfit. It's such a good color, and I feel like it's the kind of color that compliments so many skin tones. I will definitely be getting my hands on a red chunky scarf. We're gonna wrap up part two here. It was a little messy. I apologize for that. I just get so excited. I have all these thoughts and I just can't put them in a correct order. But maybe we should start categorizing them. Like comment what you want to see below. Full accessories, full tops, full bottoms, full skirts, whatever you guys want. I got you. I'm your full gal. We will be full fashion queens together."," We agreed not to wear any basic or boring pants this summer. Let's get a little embroidery, a little bit of color. That way we don't have to look like everybody on our for-do page."," Hi guys. That's been a while. I know, people have been asking for you. But we're going to a baby shower today and these are the fits. You had ping on earlier and I was gonna say did you think it was a girl? Well I didn't know. We don't know. They're not waiting out. I was wearing some newtro colors there. Yeah, but I never kind of leave it in the hallway. Anyways, I'm wearing this Alexis dress. I'm only wearing this one. I really like this. This is a great one. Is that me? Like did I like? You made a choice. I gave you a fashion show and we were like definitely keep that one. I love that. Does anyone else do that? I just got a bunch of clothes and I made him dry every single thing on. Dresses Alexis, my shoes are Dolce Vita. I love these. They're just like really easy and simple. That's it.

These are Brooks Brothers shorts. This got me that I love them. Really good in time for summer. And then Oliver Cabell's on. What about the new, the new jewelry purchase? I got a new watch. I got a nice new watch. I got a nice new watch. I got a nice new watch. Bye guys."," 15 degrees outside. I'm going to dinner. Let's get ready. Okay, I've just put on a turtle neck and fleece-line leggings, but I think I'm gonna put on one more pair of tides because it's gonna be cold outside. So the dinner place we're going to they like do not to cheese on everything. So I don't want to be bloated so we're gonna wear this to hide everything. Alright, so now that it's nice and loose I need to figure out accessories. Alright, I'm gonna wear this necklace, my watch, and I'm so cold-hoop earrings. I'm gonna show for chocolate something here I did this with this and I kind of really like just fun stuff. I can't decide which cheese I want to wear. Here's the final look. Bye!"," from last year that are gonna follow us and to fall in winter 2022 from a fashion major. First up we have pleated skirts. This year we're seeing them styled a little bit more like this, this, this, this, or this. Over all the way that I'm seeing them styled this year definitely has a bit more of an edge which leads us to the preppy style. It was so big last year and we're seeing it again but not quite like before. We're definitely still seeing that preppy and academia style but in more of a disheveled schoolgirl kind of way. Like this, this, or this. I'm definitely seeing a lot of ties too which I actually love. This style can easily be done with a lot of the trends or pieces from last year. Next up the oversized white button up or just button ups in general. We're definitely still seeing a lot of them especially in layering like this, this, or this. I'm seeing a lot of cropped button ups. I'm out of time like for part two."," 4 Beachbound looks, part 3. Starting off with this printed 2 piece bikini with a cut that I absolutely love, pairing it with this 2 piece tancan shorts crochet set that's perfect for the beach, making this a complete amount of chrome look by adding my sunglasses hat, beach bag and tan shoes. Next is a look for nighttime, I wanted to add some colors, so I went with this mini halter dress in this beautiful fiery red, bringing up the look even more with these gold accessories, here I have some earrings, a clutch and my heels. Next is another beach look, here I have a classic black one piece bikini, for my cover if I'm simply pairing it with this black textured mace grid that has a slit and is super comfortable, topping them off with my sunglasses, my beach bag and some black shoes for a super sleek look. Next is a look for a night out, here I want with this stage green mini dress that scrunches on the sides and ties at the back, I'm pleating the look with a small straw back, some brown shoes and some simple gold earrings, and you're ready to dance the night away.",,,,,,,,,

Oversized outerwear, like long loose coats and puffer jackets, will be super popular because they're stylish and keep you warm. Tweet jackets and plaid patterns are making a comeback too. Giving off a classic yet chic vibe. Monochrome looks where you dress in one color like black, gray, or beige, will be trendy as well. Chunky boots with thick soles are a must-have for winter. They're both fashionable and practical. French chic style remains strong, with simple black and white outfits, trench coats, and knit sweaters. Eco-friendly fashion is also gaining attention, with more people choosing clothes made from sustainable materials like organic cotton and recycled fabrics. Lastly, layering with turtlenecks will be a big hit, offering warmth and style. These trends will likely shape how young French women dress this winter."," this. This or this is your vibe for fall 2024 but you're not quite sure how to accomplish it. I'm here to help you out. These are all actually the same exact outfit formula and you can probably accomplish it with things you already have in your closet. I call this formula big top little bottom and it works for a more casual occasion like this with shorts, a sweater, and tall boots. Another casual option with shorts, a blazer, and flats. I love this with a monochrome look underneath and then an oversized coat. This is the same exact outfit as the last one just styled a little bit differently. Same thing but more glam. I'm loving an old school prep look. Here's another example and another one. Mom's who want cute comfy outfits right here. We're on a hat for a no wash day. A personal favorite way of doing this is monochrome on top and a contrasting shoe. Here's another example of that and here's another example of that. Notice how she's matching the shoes in the bag perfectly. I actually wore this outfit formula a couple weeks ago at a tiny luxe event and I got so many compliments on this outfit. It's also an easy way to incorporate trends like a denim on denim or bubble skirt and go full color like this and I'll leave you with this one for some simple date nine outfit and so."," If you're wanting to try some trendy touches for summer but don't know where to start, let me help you. Here's the ones I would tell you to invest in if I was styling you. Let's start with the prepants. Now I get these may not be for everyone, but they are definitely a lightweight, cute way to dress for the summer. Plus they feel refreshingly chic and can be styled super casually or a little more dressed up. And don't be afraid to try them in prints or matching sets. If you don't already know, jellies are back. Whether you go for a fun pop of color, the classic clear, but in a different shape like these ones from Jeffery Campbell, they're a fun, easy way to add a trendy touch to your summer look. The style of a fit and flare dress has been trending for a while now, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon because it's a failproof way to look chic and say cool on a summer day. You can get it in all black like this one from ASOS, all white, or even in a shorter style like this one. The secret to nailing this is making sure it's more fitted on top and more of a flare on the bottom. Whatever color combo or length you go with, you can totally style them with a pair of jellies too. These are nothing new, but as a stylist, I've noticed a lot of people loving this trend, but not knowing how to style them. And I get why. But the secret to styling a track pant for summer in 2024 is to style them with contrasting pieces. For example, I recently got this pair from ASOS, and rather than pairing them with something like a t-shirt and tennis shoes, which you would expect. I style them with a button down and ballet flat. While you may not be a fan of the track pant, maybe you'll be a fan of the track short. Since it's hot out, these are also trending this summer. And the same rules apply to styling these. Again, you'll want to go with unexpected, contrasting pieces. I'm loving these red ones from Pac-Sun. You can pair it with something lightweight and effortless, like this white tube top from Amazon, and complete with a cute pair of socks and loafers. Yes, you can wear loafers in summer. I do it all the time. If you're wanting an elegant piece that will go well with everything from skirts to long denim shorts, then you need a linen vest. And preferably two of them. Longer one, like this one from Dish. And one that hits right at the waist, like this one from ASOS. Once you have the vest, or vest, love, you'll quickly see how easy they are to style. And they'll actually become more of a capsule piece, rather than a trendy piece, as I promise you, you'll find endless ways to style them. Plus, look how cute they look paired with Capri's. Sheer skirts have become an essential part of the cool girl summer uniform. And this summer in particular, it's all about the white lace skirt. Since they're so sheer, it's best to style them with something longer, like an oversized t-shirt. Or if you want to dress it up a little bit, you can go with something like this white lace skirt from Amazon, which I think is only like 15 bucks. A long white button up, like this one from Anina Bing, and complete with some cute kitten heels. If you know me, you know I'm loving this trend, which is the silk headscarf. And that's because it's an accessory that instantly makes an outfit no matter what you're wearing, just feel looks. I recently wore a headscarf to a baseball game, and I'm literally wearing it with a white tank top, jeans, a hoodie. Adding on that blue scarf just totally changed the look. With this trend, it's all about how you make it yours, and style it to fit your personal style. And what kind of scarf you go with. If it's a hat, basic tee, and jeans kind of day, take a scarf like this one from Madewell, layered over a baseball hat, your look is instantly elevated. Or if you're just not filling your hair that day, or want to protect it from the wind, it also looks super cute worn without a hat and on its own, with something like an effortless summer dress. It's my favorite way to add a trendy pop to whatever your personal style is this summer."," So you're trying to stay on trying this season. This is what's gonna be in and out this season, just coming from somebody trying to keep up with it times. This one might be controversial, but I haven't seen dark martens lately, because instead what we're seeing are more knee high boots. On top of that, thinner heel is gonna be in over, a thicker heel boot. Maybe I'm just getting a little bit crop tops are starting to phase out and we're seeing more of a longer top that covers more of your mid-drip. Long almond shaped nails and nail art used to be in, but not anymore, because instead of the complicated nail art, we're seeing more simple designs and a shorter nail. Remember the crisscross like lace backs and you weren't in unless you had something like that. Instead of having those timelines, we're gonna go in for more of a backless look. Shears skirts were everywhere, like everywhere. But instead of the sheer skirts, we're seeing more satin skirts. I bought so many of the lace teddies, but it's not in so much anymore. Or at least I haven't seen them around lately, because lately I've been seeing the peekaboo tops. Dresses are still gonna be in, but what I've been seeing more of, a two-piece situation, the Jean Jackay was perfect for layering. Instead of a good Canadian texedo, we're seeing more of cardigans. And this really sucks, but the higher heels, not gonna be as it anymore, because the kitten heels are gonna be more in this season. By the way, this is gonna be part three. The other two are gonna be linked in my caption below, but let me know what trends that you like, which ones that you don't like. Which ones do you not agree with? Go ahead and let me know."," I have got to show you these Amazon dusters I found because if not, I feel like I'd be doing you a disservice. This is the cream. So good. I'm just glad I don't have to spend $300 on a duster anymore. I'm loving this. Let's try the other colors on. Here we have the black for like just an all good, classic look. They did come with a belt. I left them downstairs, I'm sorry. But you could button this up, belt it. I like to keep mine open. Guys, these are such a good find. I've been looking for good dusters on Amazon and I finally feel like I found them. These really pretty buttons just to kind of elevate any love. Last color I got was this camel color. So pretty, so good for fall and then brings you into the holiday. Especially with a red lip. This color, it is a classic. These are so good. I did put them in the dryer, give them a little less because they were vacuum sealed. Not go wrong. I will leave them much but hurt you because I have a feeling they're going to sell out."," I'm going to give you my 2023 fall predictions. My favorite season ever is fall. Can I wait? This is all going to be in. Whether it is a trench coat or an oversized p-coat, this is going to be in with a baggy pant and small shirt. That's probably not going to be like super realistic as it gets further into fall, but at least fall transitional will start off with small top big pant. On the other side of things, baggy top, baggy pants, ladies, go grab your boyfriend's musty jersey and put that on because it's fashion this year. Investes? That's going to be so fall. I need this look yesterday. I love this baggy top with a baggy pant and the dad shoe. And look at this vest. This is so hot. This is so 2023 fall. I've been seeing that red is absolutely going to be in this season. So anywhere that you can add that without going crazy in your wardrobe would be super dope. Like a really good pair of glasses. You can probably find off Amazon. Speaking of wearing red and being practical, a red lip would absolutely be enough to be in for the season. If denim set, look, it's baggy on the top and the bottom. It's a matching set. This is going to be so in. Riri, I love you. Denim on denim on denim on denim on baggy on baggy on sneaker on sneaker on thinker on really great glasses and red lip. This is in. This is in. Go. Speaking of matching sets and vests, this is absolutely going to be in look. It literally gives baggy and all the right places. It gives really cute vests vibes. Imagine this with like a red lip or even if you're a tennis shoe girly. What about like a red tennis shoe? Speaking of shoes, the clog berks are going to continue to be in. Literally look at this fit right here. Baggy pant, baggy top. Imagine throwing a trench coat on that or even a pico and a beanie with these. That's giving running to Trader Joe's and looking so fucking fly. This trend I absolutely hate. I only hate it for now and then it's probably going to grow on me and then you'll probably see me in it. The ballet flats. I was already talking to a shoe brand and they are launching some ballet flats that look like this. And the same vibes is like the ballet flat but it's a little bit more chunky as if it's like a loaf. I would definitely more so lean this direction. We have again the baggy top and then probably a baggy pant but regardless, it's definitely like a dad style gene. But I definitely think this is going to be in especially with the socks. And then the classic uggs it them now. Don't be like me last year trying to find people on Facebook marketplace who are reselling authentic uggs for a decent price. I absolutely think that the gene skirt is going to be in and I told my best friend that I hated the gene skirts but I definitely ordered one today. K-baves I can't wait for us to be all hot and cozy and layered and coat it up and shoot up and like experiencing the best fall yet. Go get your outfits like now."," European summer outfit and spoke, coming at you. I put together 10 head to toe outfits from Amazon, all affordable and even on sale today because of the prime day.

,," question trends they gonna be the most fun for this spring. Before hot summer we gonna have the hot girl spring. A feminine girl is out there will turn their lingerie into an outfit, expect to see lace all over, but also cool, say a lot of camisole or sleep dresses for a night out. With the temperature getting warmer, our legs deserve to be seen. So we're still gonna have a lot of mini macroscopes. Let's say have fun with styling here. If you're gonna go for a mini skirt like this, for this, to balance the proportion and perhaps wear something or volume is on top. I opinion this is the calling for the denim skirts.

If you don't know how to style it, don't worry, just match it with the other pastel colors like pink or yellow. It's the perfect combo for the chic vibe.

,," Here are the 2025 trends in fashion as a fashion designer and fashion brand builder. I'm jumping into what I'm seeing on the runway and what I think will be super trending retail and personally love of mine. So the first trend that I'm seeing and loving is the soft feminine era. So it's featuring a lot of like shears and ethereal fabrics and colors. Everything has a lot of fluidity and very delicate soft feminine and there's also a hint of like leases and different unique embroidery techniques. This is so beautiful and it's kind of a reaction to that we need a little bit more softness and delicateness in the world. This next trend is very bold. It's standing out. Kind of a shift from quiet luxury and now we're just getting loud. We're tired of seeing sameness and neutrals and minimalism and we're really putting those bold colors and embellishments front and center. I am just loving these like different embellishment details on here and the shoes and then you can see there's just some crazy shoes. A lot of primary bold colors and we're just seeing a lot of fun prints and patterns as well. Last but my favorite is this like ornate nostalgia opulence.

Next we're gonna have a cabochon rings, don't confuse them with the gemstone rings. A lot of these rings is that they bring this touch of vintage and pop of color and miso means the place that you want to have a look. I wasn't expecting this, the classic heart pendant is making a dramatic comeback, but we're gonna see a lot of poppy hearts as necklace, but also bracelets, which I guess layering with other jolores can be fun, perfect for my chic and classy girlies. Of all designs are leading the way other in-necklaces, pendants, rings, or bangles, the oval silhouettes both simple and striking.
